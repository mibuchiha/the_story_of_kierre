# The Story of Kierre

### A. A.

# Part 5

Aize was seeing sparks for a few seconds upon drowsily opening his eyes the next morning. Small wonder, considering how long he had spent staring at bolt after bolt of lightning yesterday. Though he had reached a point where a successful cast of Thunderbolt Strike was assured, he had yet to manage the performance he envisioned. That was troubling, especially considering how he was firing the spell at less than half strength in order to keep his mana supply high. Fixing this issue was one item in his plan for the day. The constraints of one attempt at full power every hour and being back home before dinner meant a maximum of nine, but that had yet to account for the other item on his list. How long would that take? Aize sighed; it was not a question he could answer by merely thinking about it. Best for him to simply go there and try.

As he left his room, he saw Mika all dressed up and ready to go out. Another practice session, he thought, but for some reason she was carrying a bag of raw meat with her. Why meat of all things? It was pretty high grade, too. He had to ask. “...um.”

“It’s to apologize to the wolves,” Mika said as she continued tying her shoelaces. He had not uttered the question out loud, but over the last few days it had become easier for them to understand each other by aura alone. Was it because they had been in each other’s psycheverses? Mika did not care; she simply loved how wonderful and convenient it was.

That explained the bag, but raised more follow up questions. Just what sort of practice did she do? “...this isn’t something to worry about, right?”

“Hehe...not at all. I’ve got this,” Mika turned around and made a peace sign to reassure him. As always, this made him squint. She chuckled and gave him a proper explanation. “I figured befriending wolves was a great idea. But they bit, so I beat ’em up.”

“I’m surprised you weren’t banned from the zoo,” Aize shrugged, surmising that she had summoning magic in mind for the exam. “Does Uncle know about this?”

“Nooo, don’t snitch! I was sent out immediately, sure, but I convinced them to leave it at that... I think. Which is why I’m going back with a gift this time!”

Aize found the chain of reasoning to be dubious at best, but it was just Mika being her adorable self. Anyway, she seemed to have it under control, and that was all that mattered. “Okay. Try to stay out of trouble, alright?”

“Will do!” Mika gave him a thumbs up and moved closer in. Aize did not think anything of it until she kissed on the cheek and said before leaving the house, “See you this evening!”

Aize stood there dumbfounded. How could she do it so naturally? She had never done anything like it for years. The butterflies in his stomach took a while to subside, and his maximum count of attempts that day dropped by one.

“I knew I’d find you here,” Witr said as he opened the door to the room housing the Seal. In the back, near the sphere, was Fayrs staring at a few screens.

“Dad.” Fayrs stood up to come to him, but Witr motioned for him to stay where he was.

“What are you researching?” Witr asked upon arriving at the desk. A glance on the screens and he could tell that Fayrs was making good of his new privileges. Normally, it would be a few more years before he would be allowed to access the information displayed.

“Psycheverses.”

“Learned anything new?”

“A lot of technicalities,” Fayrs nodded. “As for the things that matter...not really. They’re all things you’ve alluded to one way or another.”

“It will be a long journey for you,” Witr said, facing the sphere.

“Yeah. That’s why I need to catch up to your level as soon as possible.”

“I’m a mere educator who dabbled in research. Ayesha’s your benchmark. She probably knows more than any of us,” Witr said, referring to the same Ayesha who was completely silent during the transfer ceremony yesterday. She was the leading psycheverse researcher in Ayulsa. She was only two years older than Fayrs, and so, like him, had yet to be granted the rights of the official heirs of the Elders. In her case this was entirely spurious however, as she was the one who generated the latest bits of knowledge that entered the database she herself had no access to.

“...she has her own concerns to deal with,” Fayrs looked down, meaning to say that he could not possibly ask for her help. To him, that would be too much; she too was another victim of the tragedy that befell Kirana.

“You don’t need to do this alone, Fayrs. Rely on the people around you more.”

“I know, Dad. It’s just that, Ayesha, you know...” Fayrs sighed. He took a deep breath and continued. “Besides, I’m not doing this alone. I’ll be asking for advice from you and many others. Also, look, I’m studying the knowledge accumulated by the Kierre, and the recent ones were mostly discovered by her. Which is to say, I’m already receiving her help.”

Witr laughed, expecting his son to answer along those lines. Even if it would make for a rougher path ahead, he understood all too well Fayrs’ desire to receive as little direct help as possible in his quest to help Kirana. It was necessary to nudge him toward progress subtly.

“What?”

“Don’t worry about it, son. More importantly, how has your first day with the Key been?”

“Uneventful. I haven’t felt anything from it since the transfer.”

“Not the worst way to start.”

“I guess so. The thing is, it’s just...there. It doesn’t feel like something I can use.”

“You’ll reach that point eventually. Be patient. Remember, many bearers never did.”

“...right.”

“What are you planning to do in the meantime?”

“Improve my strength and continue my studies. Also do the usual Key things whenever I need to.” By which Fayrs meant playing the role as the leader of the clan. In stark contrast to the Seal, the Kierre had little use for the magical powers of the Key. In fact, the ruling families regarded it as nothing more than a threat. For generations, keeping the bearers happy with wealth and social influence was all they could do to prevent them from learning of the capabilities that could undermine the foundation of the clan. Before the invention of Infel Bale about a century ago, this was significantly harder since without it, similar to the Seal in the present day, the Key would jump to the next bearer without notice.

“Key things, eh?” Witr chuckled. “Speaking of combat, I never said this to you. Good job during the Sacred Coliseum. That was a fine new technique.”

“I have Khal to thank for that. Naga too, I guess. Thinking about it, why did you let me participate, Dad? Did you think I’d win?”

Witr smirked. “If Naga seriously tried, you’d be flattened before you knew what was going on. He’s way out of your league, young man.”

“What!? Then what about the Key?”

“The lessons you learned from the experience were worth the risk.”

“I’m surprised you managed to convince Gramps...”

“Who do you think I am?”

“Right. The head of educational matters in Ayulsa, who also led the Kierran special task force until a few years ago. A man with both vision and power, destined to lead the clan to unprecedented heights. The great Witr Kierre.” The special task force he mentioned referred to an elite division of the Kierran military reporting directly to the three Elders. Their main duties were to address the most urgent challenges the clan faced, inside or outside Ayulsa. Their missions typically revolved around a mixture of intelligence, combat, and magic, with anything from setting up critical infrastructure in perilous ley lines to assassination being common.

“Mhm. I see I’ve raised you well,” Witr nodded, basking in the glory.

“I didn’t seriously mean it, you know.”

“Keep irrelevant details to yourself.”

“Fine,” Fayrs shrugged. Then he remembered how Naga wanted to fight against Witr, and asked, “Say, Dad. How would you fare against Naga?”

“Could go either way. It’d be a war of attrition though, due to the phoenix. What a chore.”

“Did you think about sending someone else to compete on your behalf?”

“I sent you, didn’t I?”

“No, I meant like how the nobles sometimes did it. Competing to win.”

“Your grandfather was thinking of sending Klixa,” Witr said, referring to the current head of the special task force. “I was against it; Sacred Coliseum is too small a stage for him, and there’s no purpose to having him bear the Key.”

Fayrs nodded. Klixa was close to Witr, and visited the family often. Having seen it in action once, Fayrs knew about his powers. Truly a special psycheverse, deserving to be considered the ultimate weapon of the clan. He was not one to be tasked with a decorative role, especially when the same person may not bear the two powers more than once.

“Conveniently, something more urgent came up, so your grandfather didn’t need much convincing. All things considered, it couldn’t have gone any better.”

“I’m glad you think so.” Running out of topic, Fayrs continued, “I should get back to studying.”

“Are you sure that’s a good idea?”

“What do you mean? I need knowledge if I want to help Kirana.”

“You’re the type that learns better by doing. So do that. You’ll make faster progress that way.”

“Do what exactly, in this case?”

“Help people in the hospital. Get firsthand experience treating psycheverse problems. I know a good doctor, go work under her. You’ll learn a lot.”

Fayrs mulled on the option for a few seconds. Though it had not occurred to him, it did seem like a more promising path than reading research papers. “Thanks, Dad. I think that’s a great--” Before he could finish the sentence, he winced from an unexpected sensation in his head.

“What’s up?”

“Remember the area we set up near the wall? Something’s breaching into it.”

“Interesting. Check it out and let me know tonight.”

“Exactly what I’m gonna do,” Fayrs said, and the two left the room together.

Aize went to the outer ring again that morning. It was easy to go to the precise place he had in mind, as he had left a marker the day before. It was a simple magic; a stone imbued with a spell that periodically emitted pulses of mana in a characteristic pattern. Confirming the invisible wall that surrounded the area, he quickly got to work on his first business of the day; getting past it and seeing what was inside.

He began by locating the focal point of the spell that created the enclosing dome-shaped wall. To do this, he felt around with his hands. The mana flow within would induce a gradient, revealing the location of its origin.

Before long, Aize had his target located. Thankfully, it was near the ground. Had it been at the top of the dome, analyzing it would be challenging. He took the films that he used with Mika to see the flow more clearly. Just as the magical circuits were becoming visible, a thought flashed that he should learn to do this by sight. He made the films himself; in principle he only had to apply the same spell directly over his eyes. It took a couple of tries, but he was elated to pull it off. Without a medium, the maintenance was slightly harder, but he was confident that the additional cognitive load was manageable and carried on with the analysis.

Mana circulating within the dome was primarily light-elemental, with wind and fire mixed in small proportions. The magic circle surrounding the focal point had helical edges. For some reason, the pattern felt familiar. Aize materialized a few grimoires beside him and started browsing. On his third, he learned that the interlacing octagram immediately surrounding the center was called Rub el Hizb. “What a name,” he thought, as it sounded distinctly non-Kierran. He did not think more of it then - the books in his library did not come with any information on their origins - but there was little doubt that the technique behind the dome originated from outside Ayulsa. He read on, looking for the steps to remove the seal.

Aize let out a sigh. The steps were indeed there, but they required a large amount of mana. Even if he did not have to practice, it was uncertain if destroying the seal was possible at his current level. Still, he just wanted to look inside so there was no need to destroy the seal, but that did require some ingenuity. As he only had to slip in and out, a temporary opening would do the job. He went back to the pages detailing how to construct the seal; it was listed as a fairly basic one in the grimoire, so reverse-engineering it should be doable.

Doable it was, after a good hour of cross-referencing and fiddling. In parts Aize had to inject mana of the opposing elements, while in others he had to use the same elements but inverting the elemental proportions. For the boy who considered precise control his forte, it was a fun exercise. A portal opened up before him and he anxiously crossed it, keeping all his attention on his mana flow so that it would not close. The inside was misty, but before thinking about it he went back outside and made sure that he could close and reopen the portal as needed. After convincing himself that the portal could be opened in both directions, he stepped in with excitement; it was time to explore.

The feeling of the mist touching his skin made Aize realize that the area was full of natural mana. In itself that was not strange - Ayulsa was a magical city, after all - but the much higher density compared to the outside of the dome was. The mana circulating within the dome was decidedly someone’s, so perhaps the dome also served as a one-way filter? Aize shot out a dim ray of light - similar in style to Fayrs’ laser - to test the idea. It bounced off the wall once before dissipating in the distance. He shot several more intense beams in different directions to roughly map the dome with the ricocheting pattern, and saw that it was oblong, roughly the area of a powerball field. Satisfied, he went further in to begin practicing for the exam. The area being full of mana suited him perfectly; he would be able to fire significantly more spells than anticipated. Lucky!

When he was out of Shefra, Fayrs went to an open area and launched himself up. At his current speed, it took about fifteen minutes to reach the dome. Though he had no reason to worry, Fayrs still landed a few hundred meters away just in case. Upon arriving, he was surprised to find the dome intact. It was constructed using techniques native to an isolated clan that dwelled on the other side of the world, one of the numerous odd things he learned from his illustrious father. There could not have been more than a handful of people in Ayulsa who could enter without either his consent or causing some sort of damage. That left only those associated with his father in some way, and none of them would have any reason to be here. Just who was the intruder?

As soon as Fayrs entered the misty area, a bright pillar of light struck its center and a loud crash followed. “Whoa, that’s some thunder!” he gasped. On his way there, he felt that it was gradually getting colder. It had been years since he last visited, was it always this cold before? Enhancing himself, he went on.

Where the thunder struck, Fayrs saw a boy resting on the ground. He seemed too young to be the intruder, but there was nobody else around. He was relaxing near the point of impact, so the thunder was his. Also, what was with his hair color?  The boy was obviously not an average Kierre. Fayrs made a mental note to ask Witr about it later. For the moment he would only watch, without alerting him of his presence.

Minutes passed and the boy materialized a book. Fayrs was amazed at how effortlessly the sequence seemed to unfold. Aize was lying down, his head resting on his left arm. The book appeared perfectly between his fingers, already open, as if directly conjured. Normally, materialization would begin with a Kierre opening a portal at a fixed position away from their body before inserting their hand to take the desired object out of their psycheverse. More seasoned ones were able to position the portals such that the objects drop out, or even use them to launch projectiles as he did during the battle against Naga. The boy on the other hand opened and closed one so quickly it was barely perceptible, and shaped just so that his hand did not have to enter his psycheverse. Fayrs had never seen such dexterity. He sat down as Aize started reading.

Twenty minutes passed before Aize sent the book away and stood up. He began chanting and a pillar of ice appeared at the center of the crater. Fayrs watched with interest as the young mage took a deep breath and started chanting Thunderbolt Strike. A magic circle appeared under Aize’s feet and a large thunderbolt followed, completely eradicating the pillar. As the dust settled down Fayrs could see Aize looking at the crater in frustration, despite the fact that the spell was nicely executed. He let himself fall on his behind and groaned, “Agh, why is this one so hard to control!? I can’t hit the tip!”

Fayrs laughed; the boy was not content with a perfect execution of a fairly difficult spell, he also wanted to compress it! He approached him and tapped his shoulder. “Hey kid, that’s amazing, the thunder just now. And you’re good with ice too?” All the other elements as well, if he did bypass the dome by himself, but Fayrs would ask about that next. “How come?”

Not expecting anyone else in the area, and also being under the impression that he was trespassing, Aize was scared to find he was not alone. Seeing that it was the bearer of the Key himself did not help. “Lord Fayrs? W-why are you here? Uh, I’m really sorry about entering this place! I just wanted a place to practice for the exams, so please don’t punish me!”

Fayrs smirked; he was just a boy. “Only if you tell me how you came here.”

“Um, about that...” Aize averted his eyes away, hesitant to share about his psycheverse. At the same time he was also surprised at how Fayrs’ aura felt; for some reason he assumed that the Key’s would be sterner.

“Come on, I’m really curious. Tell me?” Fayrs pleaded, sitting next to Aize. Sensing his reservations, he added, “You did nothing wrong in coming here, no worries. The dome is my little magic practice, you see.”

Aize was silent. Though he was still not entirely comfortable, Fayrs seemed like a nice person. Above all, he was the Key. It was pure luck that he got to meet a bearer alone, and he would not count on getting a second chance. “I’ll tell you...if you promise to keep it a secret, and do me a small favor.”

“Alright, pinky promise,” Fayrs held his pinky finger out with a smile.

“You’re not gonna ask what favor it is first, Lord Fayrs?” Despite the question, Aize still locked Fayrs’ finger with his.

“You said it’s a small favor, and I trust you,” Fayrs said. “In return, I want you to drop the ‘Lord’. Just call me Fayrs. What’s your name?”

“My name is Aize...Fayrs,” he answered, finding it strange to directly address someone from the highest rank of nobility with no honorifics. “So, about the seal...” he materialized the grimoire from earlier, once again directly on the page of interest. “It’s a pattern called Rub el Hizb, whose construction is described in this book. Starting from here, and considering that the procedure gives the opposite result compared to this one here,” as he explained another book appeared in his left hand, “the way to create a temporary entrance becomes obvious.”

If Fayrs had any lingering doubts, they were ruled out by seeing books originating from different parts of the world materialized right before him. Especially these two; except for the missing identifying information, identical copies of each were among his father’s collections! “That’s very interesting. Are the books from your psycheverse?” He had never heard of such a world before.

Aize nodded. “It’s a library. On the one hand I’ll never run out of things to read, which is nice, but when it comes to the exams...”

“...all you’ve got are books with spells, and you aren’t sure if they count as the powers of your psycheverse?”

Aize shrugged. “Exactly.”

“Psycheverse can mean all sorts of things. I think it’s fine, you’ve got a good grasp of magic.”

“Still not good enough to precisely strike the tip, which I guess you saw just now,” Aize sighed. “Besides, the casting takes a while. I would’ve preferred something more dynamic. For example, what you used to dispatch Naga’s dragon.”

“Patience, young one,” Fayrs said, ruffling Aize’s hair. He also found himself enjoying the chat; it was like talking to a younger brother. Refreshing, considering how he was usually the inexperienced one in his interactions. “Keep working and you’ll get there before long.”

“It all comes down to practice, huh. Oh well.”

“You’re far too young to be sighing like that,” Fayrs laughed. “Anyway, you said you wanted a favor from me. What is it?”

Talking about magic distracted Aize, and the question brought him right back. He glanced at Fayrs’ left hand, gathering his courage. A few seconds later, looking at Fayrs straight in the eyes, he said, “I want to see the Key up close. To touch the mark, if you’ll let me.”

The fire in Aize’s eyes showed that it meant much more than a small favor to him. Though he did not know why, Fayrs could not help seeing himself in that obsession with the Key. So, even if it was somewhat risky, he did not have the heart to reject him outright. Just touching the mark for a short while ought to be fine. Fayrs held his left hand up so that the mark was facing Aize. “Here you go.”

Aize stared silently at the red mark. There was a certain austerity in its faint glow. “Father...” he muttered, not knowing how to express how he felt. He resolved to get closer to the Key. He held his left hand up to Fayrs’. It would be many years before he could bear this power; but now, at least, he had the chance to feel having the mark on the back of his hand.

The light of the Key engulfed the area when their hands made contact. Fayrs’ consciousness was transported to the library. He saw a stream of visions showing its many areas, starting from the lake surrounding it, the bridge heading to the entrance, the few floors above ground, and the innumerable floors below. Only, the library in his vision had people; the first few levels were staffed to facilitate the guests with their research, and the lower ones had explorers trying to establish a path going deeper still. Fayrs felt that the floors were independent realms, connected to each other only by the books they contained and the stairways leading up to the library entrance. It would be inconceivable for them all to be part of one physical building.

Aize, on the other hand, saw the radiant valley. Though it was night in his vision, the place was brighter than the busiest areas of Ayulsa due to the naturally occurring shining rocks. Based on how the light felt, there was little doubt that he was seeing Fayrs’ psycheverse. Surprisingly, the light had a gentle warmth to it. Before long, the torrent of knowledge flowing in became overwhelming and Aize fell on his knees, breaking the contact between his hand and Fayrs’. The last thing he saw was a temple located deep within a cave, though it was difficult to make out much detail due to its glowing walls.

“What was that...?” Fayrs was trembling, but seeing Aize breathing heavily on the ground snapped him out of it. “Hey, Aize! Hang in there! Let me send you home.”

“It’s at the West Sector, residential area 3. The house of Shenal Kierre...” He fell unconscious after, and the books returned to their place in the library.

“Shenal Kierre...” Fayrs committed the name to memory. He flew out of the outer ring to bring the boy home, the events that transpired still weighing on his mind.
