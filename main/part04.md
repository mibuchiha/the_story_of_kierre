# The Story of Kierre

### A. A.

# Part 4

That Thursday, Aize was in his room flipping through a handful of high level spells. Though he had agreed to demonstrate a spell on Sunday, the requirement of it being a big one did not narrow it down to a unique choice. Time was also running out. Just like Mika, he preferred to go with something outside his comfort zone, and that meant practice. Keeping Saturday purely for resting and replenishing his mana supply left him with two days worth of time. He had to settle on a choice that morning, and get a basic idea of its feasibility by the end of the day.

He stopped at a spell called Hell Dome. Its usage consisted of simultaneously dispersing mana and converting it into flames. Essentially the same as the basic fire magic he learned at school, with advanced emission thrown into the mix. While he thought that was a decent choice, the fact that it was an area-of-effect spell was inconvenient. He would be performing it on the school field, so it would engulf the other students. Although Ms. Rikka would set up a barrier, he preferred not to deal with such concerns when he had to dedicate his all into a successful cast. With a sigh, he turned the pages in search of a better choice.

Aize skimmed through the water, wind, and earth elemental spells, as they too extended over the entire school field. That brought him to the next candidate, Thunderbolt Strike. Though similar in power and technical requirements as the previous spells, it had a significantly smaller coverage. Exactly what he needed. He closed his eyes and began picturing the mana flow within him. “O the ruler of heavens...” he chanted and immediately stopped, as the mana was increasing much more rapidly than he anticipated. “Ugh, this is a strong one alright...”

Mulling over his options, Aize wondered if he could show precision instead. He was adept at controlling water temperature and pressure, thanks in part to his discomfort in using the common kettle. To make it challenging, he could try to approach one of the triple points of water. That would surely be enough to pass the examination with flying colors. However, he found himself reluctant to do so. Knowing Mika, her choice would probably involve a show of raw power, and it would no doubt be spectacular to see. On the other hand, the triple point would not be visually very striking, so this choice amounted to admitting defeat in some sense. He shook his head, dismissing the idea. His entry for the examination had to be an impressive spell both from the technical and power perspectives. Thunderbolt Strike it would be, then.

Just when he was about to start the second round of his mental training, he noticed that the air in the room felt electric. Another mana spill and he would have to spend the night feeling numb. That did not seem very comfortable. He had to find a place outside to practice, preferably one with nobody to see his failed attempts. Speaking of which, Mika had been suspiciously sneaky when she left about an hour earlier. Aize smiled; though she acted as if she was coasting through everything, she made much effort behind the scenes. He sent a message to her and Shenal that he was going out, locked the house, and started wandering about.

___

Upon reaching the junction connecting the residential area he lived in with the main street, Aize stopped and looked in the direction of the great wall enclosing Ayulsa. So majestic it seemed to the boy, this wall that isolated the Kierre clan from the rest of the world. He wondered about how only those qualified were permitted to venture outside its confines. While the need for a license was in itself not surprising, how uninterested people were in it was. Among the students of his batch, Shenal was the only parent in possession of the ambassador permit. He did not understand how that could be the case, when he would definitely apply for one in four years, right after meeting the minimum age requirement. Why were the other Kierres not keen to see the outside world? As he pondered the question, he noticed that he had never heard of a non-Kierre within Ayulsa. Surely others would be just as curious about the city where the supposedly most magical clan in the world lived? Were they prevented from entering, and why?

He decided to approach the wall, expecting to find a suitable practice area nearby. Since it was quite far, normally one would use the vehicles freely distributed around the city. They had their own mana source, and so required little of the users’ to operate. However, as with most magical appliances, they made him uncomfortable, so he opted for physical enhancement augmented with wind magic for a boost in speed. In other words, he decided to run.

He was not paying much attention while cruising through the outermost residential area. It was a bright day and the street leading to the wall was empty, so he thought there was no need to be alert. Before he knew it, he was sent tumbling by a ball the size of a basketball hitting him in the face. He frantically searched for the source of the impact and noticed a girl and her mother playing on the front lawn of a nearby house. Though the girl did not seem to think much of it, the guilty expression of the mother told him that she was indeed the culprit.

“I’m sorry! Are you alright?” the mother asked as she ran toward Aize, with the daughter cheerfully following from behind.

“Haha, big bro, you suck! That was just a pass, you know?” the girl said, pointing straight at Aize, before he could answer the mother.

“Maike, what are you saying? Apologize to big brother, now!”

“Eh, why should I?” Maike pouted, not understanding why it was made out to be her fault. “It was big bro’s fault for not catching the pass.” She ran ahead to retrieve the ball on the street.

“She’s right, it was my fault for not paying attention. But wait, that was a pass?” Considering how it killed his momentum completely, the ball packed quite some power. Maike looked to be about seven, and she was very good at enhancement for her age.

“Ahaha, yes,” the mother nodded awkwardly. “She normally plays with her father, and he’s a pro powerballer.” Powerball was one of the more popular sports in Ayulsa. It was similar to basketball with two key differences: the ball could be handled freely and the use of magic directly targeting it was allowed. Matches tended to be chaotic as dispersive spells were seen as effective, being able to simultaneously disable the opposing team and shape the playing field.

“I...see,” Aize nodded, thinking, “Maike’s dad, raising her to be a future powerball star is all good, but please do it somewhere safer. She just hurt someone today.”

“Here you go!” Maike offered the ball to Aize. “Show me your skills, big bro!”

“Sure thing,” Aize nodded and took the ball from Maike, wondering what to show her. He had only watched a few matches before, but he also did not want to turn her down.

“Is it fine? Weren’t you going somewhere?”

“It’s okay, powerball’s a good way too practice too.”

“Hurry up, big bro!”

“Alright,” Aize smirked, holding the ball up with one hand. Doing it without any incantation was difficult, and the situation being unplanned, he did not have any delayed spells stored. At the same time, Maike’s enthusiastic gaze meant failure was not an option. With some trepidation, he channeled a burst of mana into his hand and a fountain of slush shot the ball into the air. Glad that his attempt had worked, he tapped on Maike’s shoulders before putting some distance between them. “Let’s do a passing rally!”

“Here I go!” Maike got into the volleyball bumping stance. When the ball was at the appropriate height, with her hands infused with mana, she sent the ball into Aize’s direction. Since she was very excited and therefore not regulating her power, it was too strong to be a pass. In order to cushion the impact without letting Maike notice any significant enhancement in use, Aize set up a wind tunnel along the ball’s path. By the time it reached him the wind had slowed it down, making a return slush pass relatively easy. Maike clearly enjoyed it. She also enhanced her footing to keep herself from falling and sent the ball toward him again.

Aize was glad to see her having fun, but he also had to set aside most of his mana for practicing Thunderbolt Strike. At the same time, she did not give the impression that she would become tired anytime soon. Thinking about how to wrap it up quickly and subtly, when returning the ball he infused it with an amount of electricity well below her current defenses. He repeated this every pass, and although they were painless, the gentle shocks gradually built up. After about twenty rounds, Maike lost her footing from numbness, fell into the slippery slush around her, and was unable to return the pass. “Woooow! I lost! You’re good, big bro!”

“Did you like it?” Aize asked as he lifted Maike out of the pool.

“I did! I want a rematch, but I can’t move. Maybe I’ve been playing too much?” It was akin to having a full body cramp, only painless thanks to her enhancement.

“You definitely did. You need to rest now,” her mother sighed as she took Maike from Aize.

“Mmmh fine. Let’s play again sometime, big bro!”

“Yep, let’s do that. See you, Maike.”

“Oh wait, big bro. Your psycheverse must be snowy too, right? That’s why you used slush.”

The question caught Aize off guard. He did not feel like talking about his psycheverse to people he just met, and chose to avoid answering. “Um, maybe? What’s up?”

“Same with me!”

“Really? That’s nice!” Of course, Aize had no idea that Maike had an icy inner world, and him choosing slush was purely a coincidence. He was glad it turned out well nonetheless.

“It’s a cool trick that I’m gonna copy. Slippery court is tough to play in!”

“I know, right? It’s a special move for us ice users. I call it the Slush Rush!” Before anyone could point out how he was making it up on the spot, he patted her head and said, “Alright, time to go. Rest well, Maike. Practice lots when you feel good again.”

“Okay. Bye bye, big bro!”

After Maike was put in bed, her mother looked out of the window in the direction of the wall. “Us ice users, huh?” she chuckled. There were not many people who could command three elements so seamlessly, and to think one of them was someone young enough to be her son.

___

It was about five kilometers from Maike’s house to the wall. Along the way, the area was almost devoid of activity. Aize remembered asking about this outer ring of Ayulsa. By area, it spanned ten percent of the city. It was easy to understand why no one wanted to live close to the wall, but not how underutilized the area was. There were so many more things one could use it for. Farming and agriculture, for example. Would that not be cheaper than importing everything, as Ayulsa currently did? The Kierres could easily afford it, was all his teachers had to say, and he found the answer unsatisfactory. Though he dug around the city for more, there was surprisingly little on the source of goods entering the city. Aize let out a long sigh. It made him recall the first and only time Shenal reprimanded him, and the promise between the two that followed. In exchange for Shenal answering any and every question Aize might have when he reached seventeen, he would not express such doubts or concerns to anyone in Ayulsa until then, except Shenal and Mika. For now, his curiosity had to remain just that, a curiosity.

Up close, the wall with a height of one hundred meters looked oppressive. It was made mainly of stone, interleaved with metal yokes here and there, presumably for the inner frame. Unexpectedly given its sheer size, it was carved with some simple patterns and was by no means drab to look at. Magically, it was just as imposing. Though faint, Aize could feel mana coursing through the wall, its flow undoubtedly corresponding to some sort of system. How was something of this scale constructed, and what was it protecting Ayulsa against? He could not reconcile the existence of this wall with the fact that save for artisanal products, Ayulsa imported all of its circulating goods. What a strange place he was living in.

“Hey! What are you doing here?” a loud voice was heard, bringing Aize back to the present. It was one of the guards manning the checkpoint. If his hair color was not suspicious enough, he certainly made it worse by running there and then staring blankly at the wall.

“Nothing much. I’m just looking around for an open area to practice before the exams...”

“Aha. The new format using psycheverses, eh? My kid’s been worried sleepless over it too.”

“Yup. I need to practice, but it’s embarrassing, so...”

“Alright kid, I get ya. Rules are rules, though, and you know it’s forbidden to go outside. Go do your stuff inside, and let me get back to my job. Plenty of space here you can use.”

Aize was about to do so, but the guard appeared nice and his curiosity tugged at him to take the chance. “Say, uncle. Have you seen what it’s like outside the wall?”

“Of course I have, I’ve been doing this for years. What’s up?”

“Can I see it, too?”

The guard did not think there was anything of interest, but he had a soft spot for gleaming eyes. He ordered Aize to wait and went back to obtain clearance. Minutes later, he shouted from the checkpoint, “Kid! Come here!” Aize did so with springy steps and nervous excitement for the view he was soon to see.

When he arrived at the checkpoint, in addition to the guard he talked to earlier, there were several other men making merry inside. One guard let out a booming laugh when he saw Aize and asked, “So this is the brat that wants to look outside, eh?”

“Um, yes,” Aize nodded timidly, he was not good with loud people.

“Interesting hair color,” the guard remarked upon seeing his hair color. “That’s not a dye?”

“No...it really is blue like this,” Aize shook his head. With all the strangers he met that day, there was bound to be someone intrigued by his hair. Just as he was thinking that, another guard sprayed some water at him to confirm. For reasons that were not fully understood, it was futile for members of magical clans such as the Kierre to dye any part of their body since water, magical or otherwise, would wash it away without exception. People had learned to accept this fundamental truth of the world, as they did the ratio between a circle’s circumference and its radius being just above six. His unamused expression, together with the lack of washed out colors on his hair, triggered a cheer from the table. “...now you believe me.”

“Sorry about that,” the guard that sprayed him handed him a towel. “You’re a half, then?”

“Mhm,” Aize affirmed as he wiped himself dry.

“Must be a damn fine lineage, for the red to be suppressed. Where are you from, kid?”

“No idea, I don’t recall ever being outside of Ayulsa. My real parents are no more, so...”

The guard that originally asked Aize about the dye clapped his hands. “Alright, guys. That’s enough prying for the day. Let’s show the kid what he wanna see.”

“Aight,” said the guard that brought him to the checkpoint. He walked to the stairs leading up and motioned to Aize. “Come with, kid. It’s nicer up there.”

Aize did as asked, and the two guards that asked him questions followed suit, with the others carrying on with their day. It was windy at the top of the wall. To the boy who had never seen this view before, it was breathtaking. On one side, the glorious Ayulsa city he was familiar with. The outer ring was largely lush green, adorned by buildings sparsely dotting the area. They were connected to each other by well-maintained streets and artificial waterways. Further in were the four sectors, neatly divided into residential and commercial areas. In the middle was the Central Sector. Though only faintly, he could make out aspects of the Shefra Palace, the tallest building in Ayulsa, right at the center of the city. He had seen no other cities and so had no benchmark for comparison, but going by the view and the magical pulsing, he had no trouble believing that he was looking at a very advanced society.

In stark contrast to that, on the other side was a rocky desert with neither structure nor life. There was barely any mana in the land, it was arid in every sense of the word. There were also no signs of connections between Ayulsa and other places that he expected to find considering the imports. The only feature worth remarking was the mountain range in the distance, presumably surrounding the entire area just as the wall did Ayulsa. Aize paced back and forth along the sides of the wall in complete silence, taking it all in.

To the guards for whom this view was their daily life, watching the boy was amusing. He was largely reserved before, but as soon as they arrived at the top, his aura spiked right up. It reminded them of their first days on the job. They let him walk around the wall as much as he wanted. Good thing one of them had the foresight to bring their drinks along. They clinked their glasses on the arid side of the wall. “To the honest kid yearning for the outside world.”

When Aize was satisfied, having taken plenty of pictures, he joined the guards. “Thank you.”

“Did you have your fill?” the first guard that brought him there asked.

“Yep. Can’t wait to study all this.”

“It won’t come up in the exams, you know.”

“Right! I still need to practice!” Aize remembered his original purpose for venturing to the outer ring. “Oh well, the view was worth it. What time is it now?”

“Two in the afternoon. You’ll be fine, I think. You’ve got a good handle of magic.”

“I’m not so sure, but anyway. Can I come here again? I’d like for Mika to see this too.”

“Mika, your girlfriend? Not bad, kid.”

Aize went along with it, recalling what Mika said in class the other day. “She’ll love this, I’m sure. Have you been to the mountains? Maybe we can have a look what lies beyond?”

The guards laughed. “No, we haven’t, and you can’t. It’s illegal to go outside the walls, and you’re not getting us into trouble. Make that your honeymoon after you get your permits.”

“Fine, we’ll do that,” Aize smirked. After thanking the guards once again for the experience, he left to go to the area in between this checkpoint and the next that he thought would be a good practice area when he saw it from atop the wall.

In the meantime, at the zoo in the Central Sector, the largest one in Ayulsa, Mika was running away from a pack of wolves after her attempt to befriend them was unsuccessful. Outside the cage, a few other visitors were laughing, though most watched with worry. Among them were Saya and two other friends. Recalling how Mika confidently told them to never interfere before she warped in, they were at a loss on what to do.

It was evening and Fayrs was heading to the Shefra Palace for the transfer ritual. At the entrance, a woman in silky white dress was waiting for him. He guessed that she was older than him by a few years at most. With a bow she said, “welcome, Lord Fayrs. Please let me guide you to the location of the ritual. As you might already know, there will be a small celebration party beforehand. The other guests are already there.”

Fayrs nodded. “Thank you, please do that.”

“Well then, please follow me,” she said and walked into the palace. On their way to the elevator, the palace servants that they passed by respectfully bowed to Fayrs. The term servant was used to collectively refer to the workforce of the Shefra Palace, and did not carry any negative connotations in Ayulsa. In fact, they were higher up the social ladder and enjoyed more privileges than the average Kierre. At the next stratum was the lower nobility, formed by families of the head servants, whose privileges were less than only the members of the three main noble families and those appointed by them for specific roles in the clan. This being the only form of upward social mobility in Ayulsa, it was a position desired by many. Some of them took the chance to shower Fayrs with flattery while he was on his way, hoping to get into his good graces. Though it made him feel awkward, he put up with them as best as he could. The servant that was guiding him patiently waited in silence every time this happened. Finally, they reached the elevator and ascended near the top of the palace.

On his way up, Fayrs’ thoughts drifted deep underground beneath the palace, where the system that essentially all magic in Ayulsa depended on was installed. The two powers provided potentially unrestricted access to it, and it was for this reason that the High Council considered it crucial that they were borne only by those who were already aware of its existence. In other words, members of the nobility. For only they understood its significance, and thus the burden of bearing the two powers. Fayrs would gladly take on that responsibility, if it allowed him to assist the person he cared for.

Now that they were alone, the servant that had been silent until then finally spoke to him. “Lord Fayrs. Congratulations for winning the Sacred Coliseum.”

Fayrs thought that was odd. She sounded very sincere. However, since she was accompanying him to the transfer ritual, she had to be one of the head servants. In other words, she had to know about the system and what it stood for. Despite that, she congratulated him. Unsure of a good reply, he said, “Thank you. I will perform my duties to the utmost of my abilities, as is expected from a member of the three main noble families.”

She gave him the faintest hint of a smile. “I am aware that you have personally been wanting to bear the Key for a long time, Lord Fayrs. I have been rooting for you since then.”

Fayrs was incredulous. “Excuse me, are we supposed to know each other?”

“Apologies, where are my manners?” the woman bowed. “I am Elise. To answer your question, no, I do not believe you know me, but I am one of the servants attending to Lady Kirana.”

Fayrs did visit Kirana a lot. Probably, Elise saw him then. “Thank you for taking care of Kirana, and I am sorry for never trying to learn your name.”

“I am simply carrying out my duties, Lord Fayrs. Besides, what I do for Lady Kirana is insignificant compared to what you will achieve.”

Fayrs felt a chill upon hearing that. How did Elise know so much about him? Had his parents told her? Or had it been Khal? Who else had he mentioned his dream to? Naga could not have known it in any detail. Someone else among the nobles? No one came to his mind.

He might as well have spoken his thoughts aloud. “Your parents or your close friend would not do that, Lord Fayrs. Nobody told me about your dream, except yourself.”

“No, I don’t feel any...” Fayrs was going to say no mind reading magic was being used, but instead of finishing the sentence, he scanned the flow of mana around them. It was negligible. To begin with, Shefra Palace had an anti-magic system constantly active, making even basic spells difficult to use. How could Elise be using an elaborate magic and keep it hidden? Speaking of which, her aura felt so faint. That also seemed strange, as even though servants were not selected based on their combat abilities, the requirement of being proficient with magic usually implied having strength above a minimum threshold.

“By not using any, Lord Fayrs. There was simply nothing to disguise.”

“No, you’re definitely reading my mind,” Fayrs retorted. Even with his full alertness, he did not feel the slightest hint that any kind of magic was in use. “How do you do it?”

Elise chuckled. “As it happens, my psycheverse allows me to read aura. I need neither spells nor mana to activate it. I only need to pay attention.” In actuality, it took more than simply focusing at her current level. There was no reason for her to reveal to Fayrs the limitations of her power, however.

“I see...what a crazy psycheverse, huh,” Fayrs sighed, it finally fell into place. Even counting only those he personally knew, Elise was the second person with such a bizarre internal world. Perhaps such worlds were more common than he previously thought.

Elise found his reaction amusing. “As soon as you learned it was due to my psycheverse, you calmed down. You remain cautious, but unlike the others, you resign yourself to it. Most would try to put more distance instead.”

“What’s the point if you can hear inner thoughts? If I understand your powers correctly, it will just have the opposite effect,” Fayrs shrugged. “Besides, if you’re taking care of Kirana, it works better for me to have you as a friend.”

“Everything for Lady Kirana, is it?”

“Everything for Kirana.”

“I truly admire that straightforward side of you, Lord Fayrs. I suppose you will be heading there after the ritual. I will ensure that your visit is without disturbance.”

“Thank you, Elise,” Fayrs said. Shortly after they reached their intended floor, Elise escorted Fayrs to the hall where the ritual would take place.

___

When Fayrs entered the room, in addition to Elise and two other servants, there were twelve guests inside. They were all members of the three main noble families. The three members of the High Council; Assir, Dhouha and Isyaa Kierre. Their first generation heirs Maghreb, Zuhr and Witr Kierre. Except for Fayrs’ grandmother who departed the world before he was born, the spouses of the five were also present. The second generation heir of Assir was also there, his granddaughter Ayesha Kierre. With a polite bow, Fayrs said to the guests, “Thank you all of you for coming to witness the moment I become the bearer of the Key of Heavenly Blessings.”

“Excellent job defending the Key, Fayrs,” Dhouha said, offering Fayrs a handshake. “Please excuse my grandson Lahhaar not being here. As you know he is undergoing a training program in a barbaric land, so warping back home is challenging.” Barbaric was a word commonly used by those in a magical society to refer to those without.

“I understand, Lord Dhouha,” Fayrs said and accepted the offer. After having a short chat with him about Lahhaar’s training, Fayrs excused himself and greeted the other guests, beginning with Assir. Except for Ayesha who only silently nodded, others made small talk with him. Fayrs, knowing the story behind her silence, did not take any offense to that and moved on. If anything, he was grateful that she made the time to visit. In the meantime, Elise and her colleagues were busy passing drinks and snacks to the guests.

After about half an hour, it was time for the transfer. Isyaa was leading the ritual. It was conducted according to protocol, as if Fayrs was a new bearer unfamiliar with the Key. After Isyaa finished reminding Fayrs of the publicly known side effects the Key might have on its bearers, he asked, “Fayrs Kierre. Are you ready to bear one of two pillars of the clan?”

“I am.”

“Well then, hold on to the Infel Bale with your left hand,” Isyaa showed him the crystal ball that sat on the table. Normally empty, the mark of the Key was now seen inside it. Recalling that this ball was considered the finest magical achievement of the Kierres after the system itself gave Fayrs a rush of inspiration. He looked at it, and thought of the black sphere underground. “Kirana, watch me,” he thought as he grabbed the Infel Bale.

“We desire and devote our lives to the pursuit of power,” Isyaa began chanting and Infel Bale rapidly became hotter. “We wish to surpass the Lord! We yearn for all there is to obtain! Turn our strife into power! For it is justice, and with it we become the lords of all worlds!”

By the time Isyaa reached the second last line, Fayrs was enhancing his hand to the utmost. He knew that it did not matter - any sensation was purely mental - but out of instinct he did it anyway. Refusing to give in, he recalled the sense of helplessness he felt when he first received news of that fateful day. Never again. Even if the clan, nay, the entire world, declared that Kirana was beyond saving, he still would not give her up.

“Let our feelings light the way forward!” With that, the transfer spell was completed and Infel Bale was empty once again.  A mana shockwave spread out of the Infel Bale, and the palace rapidly absorbed it. When Fayrs came to, Isyaa said to him, “You are now the rightful bearer of the Key of Heavenly Blessings, Fayrs Kierre. Come now, lift your hand up.”

Fayrs turned to face the guests and did as suggested. The mark at the back of his left hand glowed red, its light filling the room. Starting with Witr, the guests cheered, and the second part of the celebration party began.

___

An hour later, Fayrs was in the elevator again, heading to the second lowest floor of Shefra, right above the system. More exactly, he was going to the room with the black sphere. On his way, he stared at the mark of the Key, and the reminders he received time and again about it overwhelming its bearers came to mind. He also heard of multiple bearers receiving a torrent of knowledge as soon as it formed a link with their psycheverses. Yet, with him, it was silent. Considering that he was bearing such a complex magic, he did not even feel any heaviness; in fact he felt lighter than before. Did the Key deem him an unworthy bearer, just like that bearer whose failure robbed Kirana of her light, and therefore spared him from its burden? Or was it another form of test? Only the Key itself knew.

Fayrs shook his head. His mission to master the power remained unchanged. Though the irony did not escape him, he resolved that it would be brought full circle. Just as it was the Key that sent her down the depths of despair, with the Key he would pull her out of it. He entered the room and closed the door without switching on the lamp. By the aura he knew it had not changed since his last visit. Then he realized that it would be more surprising if it did, considering that his last visit had not been very long ago. Furthermore, there was no reason for the room to change, as its only purpose was to store the black sphere far from any disturbance. He brought a chair in front of the sphere and sat on it.

“Hi, Kirana,” he said to the sphere, showing it the mark of the Key. “I’m sorry it’s taken me so long, but I’ve finally done it. I’m the Key now.”

Silence. Fayrs knew there would be no reply, but he kept on. “Did you watch my battle? Naga’s awesome, you know? Yeah, I know he let me win but I think I did well. I feel like I’ve improved a lot! Especially the new technique I used to take down the huge dragon. It was cool, right? Believe it or not, it was Khal who gave me the idea.”

Still silence. Fayrs suppressed his mana flow to dim the light of the Key. In that darkness, the slightest tinge of blue inside the sphere became visible. He reached into the sphere and felt his mana seeping out from the portion of his hand that was inside. He paid it no heed. Seeing his red mingle with the blue made him euphoric.

When he was satisfied, he pulled the blue mark just outside the sphere. He did so with utmost delicacy, for it rested on the back of Kirana’s right hand. She had since long been laying motionless inside the sphere as the bearer of the Seal of Forbidden Vault, carrying the weight of the clan with her frail shoulders. Any trace of hope for her vanished on that day four years ago, when the sphere turned pitch black, following the complete collapse of her psycheverse.

Fayrs gently kissed her hand. The tears that were welling in his eyes fell onto her hand; he had been waiting to say it for so long. “We’re partners now, Kirana. You’re no longer alone.”
