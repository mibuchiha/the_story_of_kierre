# The Story of Kierre

### A. A.

# Part 2

As Fayrs made his way into the arena, he gazed at Naga’s imposing figure. His fierce smirk, blazing scarlet hair, and the intensity of his aura was akin to walking into flames for the young Fayrs. Tuning out the cheers of the audience and the presence of the referee alike, Fayrs got into his stance and said to his opponent, “I’ve heard a lot about you, Naga. Today, I’ll surpass you and prove my worth.”

“Heh. No rush, young man. I was surprised when you joined instead of the Professor, but you made it to this stage. I’m honestly impressed.”

“I’m sorry I’m not Dad, but all the same, you won’t be bearing the Key. I will,” Fayrs declared as he clenched his fists and prepared some portals around him. He added in his mind, “Wait for me, Kirana. Just a bit more.”

“Prove it with your power,” Naga replied, enjoying the fire in his opponents’ eyes. Likewise, he prepared his portals.

That was the cue for the referee. She raised her hand and announced, “The finals of the Sacred Coliseum...let the match begin!” Right after, she was warped outside the arena to safety. At the same time, brilliant flashes shone from her left as laser beams were fired from the portals Fayrs prepared. Had she been one moment late, and not protected by the same system set in place to ensure no one but the competitors suffered any damage, they would have vaporized her.

From Naga’s portals, multiple jet-black serpents emerged, ready to tear at the youth within the light. Before unleashing them, however, with only minimal mana enhancement Naga deftly parried the beams away from his portals. Upon impacting the shields separating the arena and the audience, explosions that followed served as testament to the destructive powers of Fayrs Kierre. His supporters roared at the display, showing their approval for the rising star. Naga paid them no heed and commanded the shadow wyrms to strike. He himself stood in place, initiating the sequence of a large summoning.

“Not so fast!” Fayrs screamed, letting another barrage of beams loose to cull as many of the wyrms as possible in a single attack. That was when he found that they were not merely black in color; while their affinity for darkness meant that his rays were particularly effective, it also meant that one wyrm was enough to neutralize a single beam. Considering that Naga summoned a large batch with relatively little mana for each, and Fayrs focused on eliminating them with sheer force, their first exchange was strictly in Naga’s favor. Precious moments were lost with Fayrs shooting a myriad of rays to wipe the remaining wyrms. When he was done, he rushed toward his opponent. From the audience seats, Aize and Mika focused mana into their eyes to see past the glitter, following the battle as closely as they could.

As soon as Naga was within reach, Fayrs threw a punch toward his ribcage. While it would be naive of him to expect it to maim the opponent unprepared, the slight tinge of disappointment came nonetheless when the blow was calmly blocked. A left swing promptly followed, Naga seemed unfazed at having to pause his summoning. Fayrs noted that the strike was unnaturally wide from Naga putting too much strength into his shoulders. He stepped back to avoid it, and immediately pivoted into a roundhouse kick to exploit the opening. Little did he know that it was Naga’s plan all along. “That won’t do!” he yelled as he crouched and tripped Fayrs’ supporting foot. A rising uppercut, enveloped with the same shadowy miasma that the wyrms emitted, was about to smash the back of Fayrs’ head as he lost his balance.

“Oh, shut up!” Fayrs was not about to let it end so simply. He opened two layers of portals in the space between his head and Naga’s hand. The upper one formed plane shields to protect himself with and the lower one opened fire to reduce the momentum of the incoming blow. That resulted in another explosion engulfing the two, and they were thrown meters away in opposite directions. Although the damage he sustained was far from ideal, to Fayrs it was infinitely better than being knocked unconscious right then and there. Two exchanges - one mana skirmish, another close combat - both did not go his way. Did he manage to disrupt the big summon, at least?

“Now that’s better. You need training in close combat, but your synchronization and power are excellent,” Naga said, stabilizing his body. He too did not get out of the exchange unscathed. It was hard for Fayrs to get a read on the summoning, the aura around him was simply...stable.

“What excellent power? You’re barely hurt, uncle,” Fayrs said, annoyed that his opponent was clearly not taking it seriously. He scattered some pebbles from his psycheverse on the ground, to increase his firing rate beyond the number of portals he could simultaneously maintain. “No matter, you’ll feel the next one for sure.”

“After you feel my next blow,” Naga smirked. First the aura around him spiked, and then the space above him distorted. From the amount of mana seething out, Fayrs understood that the magnitude of that thing about to join the fray was unlike anything he had accounted for.

“How did he maintain his link through all that...?” Fayrs was bewildered. It was not trivial for him to keep up with the magical load of his portals through the match so far, and Naga was doing the same while summoning a monstrosity. In desperation he fired using the pebbles, but before the rays reached Naga a pair of stone wings appeared around him, shielding him from harm. An explosion followed, obscuring visibility, but the distortion above was a clear indication that Naga was in no way harmed. The otherworldly aura emitting from it was only getting stronger.

“Crap, that can’t be good,” Fayrs uttered, realizing that there was no preventing the summoning at this point. Even piercing through the gargoyle defense would likely prove challenging. He scattered as many pebbles as he could and formed multiple layers of shields around him. As the hemispherical shields took shape, Fayrs wondered how he could escape from his current predicament.

___

“Wow. Naga’s good...” Aize said, his gaze fixated on the large portal above Naga. Although the creature to be summoned had yet to take shape in the mortal realm, from the flow of mana around the portal Aize knew it was a dragon. “He didn’t lose focus after being shot point blank... Fayrs’ also not bad. He controlled the portals very precisely in that last attack. His net shield has to contain at least dozens of intersections, and he did all that while falling down.”

Shenal smiled. As Aize was normally so reserved, preferring to spend his time reading, it made him happy that he was showing so much interest in the battle. Then he turned to his daughter who was clinging to him.

“Oh no, that dragon looks scary...” she said, she too was reading into the mana flow like Aize.  “Will Fayrs be okay, Papa? He has to be, right?”

“That depends on how strong his shield is, Mika,” Aize answered her before Shenal did. “It doesn’t look good for him though.”

“Please be alright, Fayrs...” Mika said as if praying. Naga’s summoning was nearing completion, and with that the form of the dragon was gradually consolidating. Mika had a feeling that Fayrs shields would be vaporized as soon as the dragon breathed, and the lingering heat would prevent him from forming another. Her eyes became teary; as much as she wanted him to win, she could not see how that was possible given the gap of ability between him and his opponent.

Shenal patted her head. “Don’t worry dear. He came all the way to the finals. He wouldn’t go down so easily.” It was not merely to reassure her that he said that. While Fayrs indeed lacked experience, his talent was the real deal. Furthermore, Shenal knew that Naga saw the battle as a practice match from the moment he defended himself using the gargoyle. The beams were not much stronger than the barrage he parried without trouble when the match began. If Naga was intent on winning, there were multiple opportunities for him to swiftly finish Fayrs off, given his skillset. It was possible that he participated mainly to fight against good opponents, particularly the less accessible ones such as Fayrs’ father. Whatever his intentions and interests for the Key were, Shenal silently thanked his friend and previous colleague, as his approach made for a battle that was easier for Mika and Aize to follow and learn from.

The large portal gradually dissipated, revealing the majestic silver white dragon in the skies above the arena. It began focusing mana between its jaws, practically announcing the punishment Fayrs was to endure. At the same time the gargoyle protecting Naga started to open its wings, revealing him chanting with full concentration. Did he want to fuel his next attack with as much mana as possible, or was he merely teasing a response out of the currently passive Fayrs? Regardless, it opened up some lines of fire for the youth. “Not yet...” Aize said with bated breath upon noticing them.

“Now!” he said as soon as there were enough pebbles to fire through the opening. As if responding to his call, laser rays shot out toward the enemy. It did little damage, as Naga had sufficient time to restore his defenses. However, it did require him to split his mana into fueling both the dragon and the gargoyle, and this allowed more time for Fayrs to prepare himself against the dragon’s first attack.

“Damn, I’m gonna be baked alive at this rate...” Fayrs knew that his shields were not up to the task of defending against the dragon. Neither did he get the confidence that his other preparations were up to snuff. Up until the semifinals, the match was as good as won once he managed to set the arena up with his pebbles. However, here he was rapidly firing at his opponent, draining his mana to cause virtually no damage, only stalling for time and delaying the inevitable. The dragon was not moving in the air and Fayrs chose to leave it alone; he did not have the luxury to divide his powers at the moment. His mind raced in search for a ray of hope, that little something that would grant him a chance of victory. A decidedly superior technique, both offensively and defensively, compared to anything he had in his arsenal at the moment.

That was when it came to him. “Wait, what if I...” Fayrs pondered, recalling a talk he had with a friend some time ago.

___

The two young men, Fayrs and Khal Kierre, were resting after their combat training. Khal was a member of a minor noble family that was affiliated with Fayrs’. They were close friends, due to being of the same age and therefore having spent much of their childhood together. The two often talked about random thoughts that came to their minds, be they about members of their social circle, new combat techniques, aspirations for the future, or any other topic that interested them. That fine afternoon was no different.

“I have a very cool idea,” Khal abruptly began after emptying his bottle of energy drink.

“What, yet another insane way to fly?” Fayrs guessed. Nine times out of ten, whenever Khal had a new idea, it would be related to flight in some way. To be able to fly was more than a dream to him, it was closer to an obsession. The wind of fortune was, in Khal’s case, a headwind however, for his psycheverse was a world of marbles.

“Damn right,” Khal grinned, excited to share his eureka moment. “Trust me this is gonna blow your mind.”

“As if. Don’t be cooking up shenanigans and learn wind magic already. You know that’s the quickest way for us both,” Fayrs sighed. An earth psycheverse on one hand, and a light one on the other. Both offered no obvious ways to fly.

“I’m learning, but without a natural affinity I won’t be flying with that anytime soon,” Khal retorted. “Using my method you can fly just using your psycheverse. As good an affinity as a Kierre can ever get. That’s awesome or what?” Khal tried to persuade Fayrs to hear him out.

Fayrs was not exactly interested, but he knew there would be no end to it until Khal got it out of his system somehow. He told himself what a nice friend he was by listening to him willingly. That was when he noticed something odd and asked, “Wait. My psycheverse? So it’s not a way for you to fly, then?”

“Unfortunately you’ll be flying before me, yep,” Khal shrugged. “I’ll figure something out soon enough. Anyway, hear me out.”

“What’s the big idea?”

“Make a shield for me. If I recall, yours is a plane shield.”

“Sure,” Fayrs nodded and held his hand out. Six portals appeared before it and laser rays were fired from one portal to another in a hexagonal pattern. The area enclosed by it glowed with a kind of energy that felt solid to the touch when Khal tried to poke it. Fayrs varied the distance between the portals without changing the amount of mana in the rays to demonstrate the behavior of the shield. It shone the brightest when the portals were close by, indicating that the strength of the shield was affected by both the amount of mana he put in and how wide an area it covered. He then made another shield next to the one he had, showing that multiple tiles could share the same node.

“Good, good. As expected,” Khal mumbled, thinking about how best to explain his idea. After some seconds, he asked, “You can defend yourself from your laser with it?”

“Never tried that,” Fayrs was confused by the question. “Why would I? I can just absorb it back into the valley.”

“Try it out. It’s important if you wanna fly.”

“I’m not seeing it, but okay,” Fayrs said, pointing to the shield he made with his other hand, and fired at it. Sure enough, the shield blocked the ray and the mana powering both evaporated into the air. “Other than wasting mana, I don’t know what I’m doing.”

“Nah, it’s all good. Another question. You know how a shield is useful because it spreads the force of an attack around, which is then more easily absorbed. In other words, it reduces pressure. So, without anything to do the absorbing...” Khal materialized a slate of marble and lightly threw it straight up. At the peak of its trajectory, he slapped it away to illustrate his point. “...it’s just a piece of solid. Doesn’t matter how hard it is. So?”

“Does the same idea apply to mine? Of course it does. It’s pinned to the portals I’m firing from,” Fayrs explained while watching Khal’s slate disappearing back into his psycheverse. “What about it?”

“Can you unpin it?” Khal was getting more excited, things were going exactly as he imagined it. “I mean, let the shield be pushed around.”

“Can do,” Fayrs nodded. “I can unhinge the nodes off the portals, and the shield would be free to move around. It’s more difficult, but I can also allow the nodes to move while keeping them attached to the portals, but only to an extent...”

“Oh wow, that’s some advanced stuff. Perfect. Well then, this is how you fly,” Khal said and described what he had in mind.

As Fayrs heard the method, his expression changed from confusion to horror. “What the hell!?” was his response as soon as Khal was finished. “That’s bull, man! I won’t do it!”

“It’s cool, right? Sure it’s not really flying but it’s pretty damn close,” Khal laughed at his friend’s reaction. “Lucky you, this particular method isn’t possible with my psycheverse.”

___

“Still the dumbest way to fly I’ve ever heard of, but I owe you one,” Fayrs smirked as he looked at the dragon in the sky. “Watch me bring the damn thing down, Khal.” He thinned the mana supply to the shields surrounding him in preparation for his next move. It was a huge gamble, but the uncertainty was still preferable to slowly being roasted to defeat. The dragon’s flare was scorching already from a distance, there was no need to test how his shields would fare against it. Especially not with him right inside.

Noticing Fayrs’ changing aura, Naga could not help smiling. It was clear that the young man came up with some kind of plan. He liked the growth he saw; just moments ago the youth was desperate. He was not about to make it easy on him, however. To deny him the precious moments to amass more mana, Naga signaled for the dragon to fire. “Go, Diaraag! Gem to ash!”

With that, a tremendous blue flare came crashing down the arena. Although its aura was oppressive, its radiance did not overwhelm the eyes. The whole sequence lasted barely a second, but to Aize who was trying to follow every detail, it felt much longer. He looked in awe at its augustness. He could feel the intense heat even through the huge shield surrounding the spectator area. “This is mastery of the psycheverse at its highest...” he thought, studying every action taken by the two men. Mika also felt the same; though moments ago she was worried for Fayrs, now she was entranced by the sheer magical display she was watching.

Time was of the essence. Portals appeared around Fayrs and they were connected by multiple rays, resulting in numerous tiny shields in the form of an armor. He was by no means confident of having everything under control, for the mana and precision such a technique required were off the scale. He had not the luxury of hesitation however, as he was about to be surrounded by hot plasma. Fayrs lightly leaped and more portals opened under his feet. As soon as his outer shields made contact with the flare, the floor he stood on shone brightly and he dashed out at breakneck speed.

___

The theory behind Fayrs’ new technique was simple. By using his shields as armor, he could simultaneously protect himself from the heat of the laser and maximize its momentum transfer. Adjusting his speed and trajectory was done by carefully controlling where and when to fire, as well as the strength of each ray. In practice however, Fayrs found it much more demanding than he had originally anticipated. In addition to the armor and the propelling laser rays, he had to keep his body enhanced at all times to withstand the repeated rapid accelerations. It also required impeccable focus to keep his armor with him mid dash, and accurately estimating the next location and timing for the next set of rays was anything but trivial, especially given the constraints on the number of portals he could maintain and the distance within which he could open them. It was not like his mental processes sped up only because he was physically moving at great speeds, and that made the already challenging tasks much harder. 

From Naga’s view, there was a bright flash and a ray shot out of the melting hemispherical shield. He did not see it, but judging by its aura, size and speed, he knew it was Fayrs. He channeled some of Diaraag’s power into himself and blasted a fireball from his mouth. While it was significantly smaller than the one Diaraag fired moments ago, it would still interfere with Fayrs’ shields and bring his technique into disarray. Fayrs simply hurled himself out like a rifle bullet. He should not be able to react in time, much less prepare a counterattack. Naga followed right behind the fireball, his right fist enhanced to the brim, ready to strike the youth down as soon as the fireball stopped him in his tracks. While Fayrs’ speed was much greater than what Naga considered him to be capable of, he had no doubt that given the distance between them and his superior combat experience, he would be able to execute the strike flawlessly.

Fayrs had no awareness of any of this transpiring. It was fortunate that he never planned to use his speed to ram Naga in the first place. The dash was only a little detour to avoid taking on Diaraag’s flare head on, as he had no interest in attempting to compensate for his shields melting mid-dash. Between him and the fireball, the floor flashed as portals were opened. They fired when he was right above it, shooting him upward. The pain of forcibly changing his trajectory ate away at him, but Fayrs still glanced down to check what Naga was up to. He had to be kept busy, after all, or another monster could very well join the fray.

Naga was shocked when a second flash occurred and the fireball passed through without a target. Before he could jump in pursuit, the portals that Fayrs used to jump up fired at him from the front, in concert with the pebbles scattered on the arena from all directions. This time there was genuinely no parrying them all; the gargoyle was summoned out of necessity. In the meantime, another set of portals opened midair, hurling Fayrs toward Diaraag. It breathed fire to stop Fayrs’ assault, but as speed was clearly not its forte, at close distances Fayrs held an overwhelming advantage. His shields were stripped bare by the flames when he landed on its head, but it mattered little, for he managed to arrive where he wanted to be. He applied another layer over himself, emphasizing his right hand, and delivered a laser-boosted punch right into Diaraag’s left eye. An explosion followed and he was thrown off the roaring dragon. His head was hurting like never before but he powered through; even if it was a direct hit on a sensitive spot, a single attack proved insufficient. All the same, Diaraag had to be taken out of the picture pronto. The thousands of portals he was maintaining for his flight and to keep Naga on the defensive were draining his mana at a staggering rate.

Conveniently, Diaraag’s size made it an easy target. Fayrs rammed it on the abdomen and jumped to its shoulder. Unable to remove the nimble threat with its short limbs, Diaraag resorted to sheer aura density and converted the mana surrounding its body to blue flames. The extreme temperatures forced Fayrs to distance himself, and Diaraag blasted fire whenever it saw him. It was not difficult for him to dodge at his current speeds, and he did so at the very last moment to lure the dragon to continue firing, chipping away at its summoner’s mana supply.

On the arena, Naga escaped the continuous bombardment thanks to Diaraag’s flare vaporizing the less supported portals there. However, the fact that it was magically tremendous was also a double-edged sword, as Naga also had to be concerned with his rapidly depleting store of mana. Regaining control of the rampaging Diaraag in his current state would prove tricky, so he summoned shadow wyrms around Fayrs to control his trajectory. In order to keep his shields intact Fayrs had little choice but to oblige, and at the end of the tunnel was Naga, enveloped in the same blue flare that he could only avoid before. “It ends here, Fayrs.”

“Yeah, for you!” Fayrs accepted the invitation for the contest of power. Disabling all the portals and pebbles around the arena, he focused all his remaining power on his last attack. The center of the battlefield shone bright and the biggest explosion thus far followed. Diaraag on the other hand disappeared from view, its link to the summoner severed during the showdown.

___

The billowing smoke allowed some respite for Aize and Mika to catch their breath. They were still processing what they had seen. The rest of the audience was cheering loudly, but they were silent in awe. Who they supported no longer mattered; they were completely absorbed with understanding the exchanges between the combatants.

“That was crazy.” Aize broke the silence. “Sure, he had to come up with an answer to the dragon, but still...”

Mika nodded in agreement. “Papa, Fayrs was really firing at himself, right?”

Shenal affirmed it and sighed. The desperation for the Key that Fayrs displayed was making him nostalgic. “He’s just like you back then, Resh. Reckless.”

The mention of his father’s name caught Aize’s attention. “Did Father also fight like Fayrs?”

“He did. He was also around Fayrs’ age at the time,” Shenal nodded. He was smiling, but his tone was undoubtedly one of sadness. “He wanted power, and struggled to obtain it.”

“The Key of Heavenly Blessings huh...” Aize wondered what it was about the Key that such powerful men were fighting for it. Was it merely to prove their strength, to consolidate their standing in the clan? That made little sense to him. He saw how Fayrs grew leaps and bounds over the course of minutes. As a noble heir, he would have been influential even without the Key. It could not be his driving force. Most of all, he refused to believe that his father was one to be moved by influence. There had to be more to the Key.

“Aize, do you want to bear the Key?” Shenal asked while patting the boy. He recalled the day when Resh met him before leaving the clan. He never explained his choices. He only claimed that the two powers were repulsive, and those at the top of the clan were rotten to the core. Then he remembered the day he brought Resh back to Ayulsa. Even then he never justified his deeds nor spoke of his reasons. He only pleaded that Shenal take care of his son. Although from time to time Shenal felt guilt toward Aize for being the captor of Resh, he tried to not let it show, in order to honor the last request of his friend the best he could.

“I don’t know,” Aize answered. “I just wonder why these men fought so hard for it. Why Father did, and what drove him to leave the clan...”

“Perhaps we’ll get the answer someday. I want to know too,” Shenal said, thinking that in a few years he would be free to uncover the mystery. Once Aize and Mika came of age, they would be able to take care of themselves. He would tell them everything he knew then. Both for himself, and to honor the promise he made with his late wife Miakis when the children were about to enter primary school several years ago.

Mika looked at them both with a worried expression. She knew about Resh as much as Aize did, and so understood his admiration for him. However, similar to Aize, she was not aware that it was Shenal who arrested Resh. As such, she found her father’s expression to be somewhat odd.

___

“How will this battle turn out?” the referee asked as the smoke slowly receded, restoring visibility in the arena. “As we all know, there’s no such thing as a draw in this! Will it be decided by popular vote!?”

Deep underground somewhere in the city, Isyaa was watching a live feed of the battle. It was a large, dark room with an eerie aura within. The source of the aura was a floating black sphere at the end of the room. While it could not have been comfortable to be in, Isyaa had to be there. He had to be as close to the core of the system as possible in order to control the flow of the battle. He too would have preferred that his grandson grasped victory through his own abilities, but personal feelings mattered little if he lacked the power to achieve it. The color of the sphere served as proof that no one should be allowed the Key except the noble bloodline and Isyaa was willing to do anything to ensure that.

He walked to the sphere and his aura strengthened. Then, in a moment of grandfatherly love, he indulged his grandson one last chance. “Report the status of Fayrs and Naga Kierre,” he ordered the sphere, or rather, the being inside it.

The voice that responded to him was weak and lifeless. “Fayrs Kierre is in a poor state. His mana supply is low, and he is suffering great stress from the numerous portal manipulations he performed. He will likely need a while before being able to use magic again. Naga Kierre on the other hand is in a relatively better state. He spent more mana than Fayrs, but he also has a larger supply. Therefore, their current levels are similar. He is suffering a major broken link, but his world is otherwise stable.”

“I see,” Isyaa said, steeling himself upon hearing the report he would have preferred not to. A tome appeared in his hand and he flipped through its pages. The mana enveloping him drew out a magic circle under his feet, as he searched for the right spell. Too large an interference risked being obvious, so he had to choose one with subtle effects. Just as he was about to start chanting, a rustling sound was heard from the screen.

“Don’t be joking now...” Fayrs was shaking, but he slowly stood up. “I’ll settle this myself!” Was he speaking to the referee, or did he realize what Isyaa was planning to do? While there was no way of knowing, the conviction in his voice was clear.

Though the strength of his aura was no reason to be confident in his victory, Isyaa still paused the ritual at the last moment out of respect for his grandson’s resolve. Though it was risky, a well-timed activation of the spell would still be able to turn things around. Isyaa materialized a gemstone in his hand and shattered it. It dispersed into pure mana that enveloped his body, strengthening his connection to the system. He would be able to strike directly at Naga’s psycheverse at any moment. Just in case, he also prepared a remote healing spell, as Fayrs had to be in a convincing state before the audience to be declared the victor.

“Heh, you got it, Fayrs,” Naga said as he too slowly rose from the ground. “The one to be the next Key will be decided by us.” He reinforced himself with his remaining mana. He was having so much fun, it would be a pity to let it end with mere votes.

Fayrs looked at his opponent and thought it was the only chance for him to ask the question he had been thinking about since before the match started. Considering how strongly he desired the Key, he wondered if the man before him also had a similar resolve. “Naga, tell me something. What will you do once you become the Key?”

“No idea,” came the answer. “I’ll think about it after I win.”

“What? You don’t even know!?” The answer, and more convincingly the tone with which it was uttered, was so different from what Fayrs expected that he found it utterly incredible. “For what purpose do you desire its power, then?”

“Nothing in particular. I only thought it’d be interesting to check it out.”

“Without any reason whatsoever, you came all the way...” Fayrs shook his head. So ridiculous it seemed to him that in indignation he managed to gather some mana to continue the fight. Unlike his faithless enemy, he was fighting for a cause more worthy than any other.

“I’m here to sate my curiosity,” Naga said, looking at Fayrs in the eyes. “Make of it what you will. History is for the strong to write.”

“...right”, Fayrs nodded. On that, he could not agree more. “Let’s settle this.” He wrapped his limbs with the net shield. It was significantly weaker than before, so the propelling laser would probably be the same. That was all he could manage in this condition. Even so, he would see it through. Kirana’s face flashed in his mind.

Naga was grinning. He was disappointed upon finding out that Witr would not be competing in the Coliseum. While Fayrs was indeed very talented, he was nowhere near a level to be considered a threat. Naga entered the finals with the intention of toying with him a little, which was why he opted to fight primarily as a mage rather than his usual style. Diaraag was intended mainly as an unnecessarily spectacular display of power, both to crush the youth’s will and to provide the audience with something to be excited about. He never expected Fayrs to face the challenge head on, and went as far as severing his summoning. Fayrs went well beyond his expectations, and he found himself looking forward to how the youth would improve in the future.

The two men charged toward each other. Fayrs threw a straight right that Naga deftly blocked. Considering the state Fayrs was in, his fist contained considerable strength. Due to Naga’s superior experience however, it was not difficult to read Fayrs’ movements. Making use of the gap between successive strikes, he struck Fayrs with his remaining arm, aiming for his heart. That would settle the match; he could not possibly get up after taking the blow.

To Naga’s surprise, some time passed and he still did not register the sensation of impact he was expecting. Instead, his fist felt hot. He realized that his punch was stopped by laser beams fired from portals opening up in the space between them. Fayrs disabled the shield surrounding him to concentrate on this method of defense. He then punched Naga’s face with all his strength. “Wha...” Naga was shocked to receive the blow. He thought he was reading ahead of the youth, it turned out he was being read instead. He could not have disabled the shield and fired in time otherwise.

“It’s my win...” Fayrs declared as both contestants collapsed to the ground.

Naga stared at the blue sky, thinking of this ardent youth that stood in his way. He decided that his wish was worth asking about. “Tell me why you want the Key, Fayrs Kierre.”

Fayrs hesitated at first. He looked at Naga and changed his mind after seeing his sincere expression. “There’s someone I wish to help. For her, I would do anything,” he answered, thinking of Kirana.

Naga laughed loudly. In the Sacred Coliseum and other clan-wide combat tournaments, the three main noble families never directly competed against each other. Instead, they opted to take turns sending a representative. It was not difficult to imagine the sneer a family would suffer if their representative ended up losing, so each time the most capable fighter would be sent. Therefore, it could not have been easy for Fayrs to earn the right to compete, especially when at stake was the right to bear the clan’s most coveted power. To think that he went through the trouble for the sake of a lady! Naga loved how refreshingly simple his motivation was. Even though Naga disliked the nobility, due to their rigidity in ruling the clan and the lengths they were willing to go to to stay in power, he felt that it would be fine to let Fayrs bear the Key. There was no longer a need for him to stand in the youth’s way. “Very well, it’s my defeat. I trust you to ignite the flames of rebirth for the clan.” As he finished that sentence, the two men were surrounded by intense flames burning out of the floor.

Far from being hurt, the flames were healing Fayrs. He was initially surprised at how strong its rejuvenating effects were, but quickly picked up their implications and became annoyed instead. “A phoenix, huh... damn it. You still have something like that under your sleeves!”

“That’s the World of Wings and Scales for you,” Naga got up on his feet and helped Fayrs to stand. “The Key isn’t something you can take lightly.” Although Naga was not speaking from experience, tales abound within the clan about the risks of being involved with the two powers. The nobility tried to cover them up, but one only had to know where to look. His warning to Fayrs was born out of a sincere wish for him to not be swallowed by the power. “Handle it well. I hope you’ll manage to help her with it.”

“I know that better than anyone,” Fayrs replied, accepting his handshake. “I’ll be the greatest bearer the clan has ever seen. All for her sake.”

Naga went to the referee and announced his surrender. She was confused before announcing it to the audience, declaring the end of the Sacred Coliseum. It was naturally met with a mixed reaction, but the unrest gradually settled down as both combatants simply left the arena. Deep underground, though Isyaa was not expecting that Naga would throw the towel, he was glad all the same that Fayrs was to be the next bearer of the Key of Heavenly Blessings.
