# The Story of Kierre

### A. A.

# Prologue

Resh stared deep into the flames. Weak and wounded, he was barely able to move. He considered letting it all go. Everything he fought for was gone, destroyed. He had lost his beloved, because of his own powerlessness no less. Only death awaited a man like him. In fact, it should have taken him long ago, if not for the frail life in his arms. Even if he had nothing else, even if the whole world was against him, he could not give up. All for his dearest son.

He stared at the red mark at the back of his left hand. “Some life I’ve lived because of this,” he smirked, remembering how he used to earnestly revere it before. “How foolish,” he said of his younger self, “to think that I wanted to protect others with it.” He felt a tinge of disgust at how the mark was shining brighter than ever, when he had no mana left in him.

He recalled the last months of his student days about six years ago. The moment when it all began.

___

It was the day Resh had been looking forward to. Every year, a student was allowed to converse with the Key of the Heavenly Blessings, the leader of the clan. Even more than the sociopolitical influence the position commanded, he admired the other responsibilities that came with it. The Key of Heavenly Blessings is one of the two greatest powers in the clan. Only the strongest were chosen, as it was a role possible only for them. As the best student in the school, both in academic and fighting prowess, his selection was the obvious outcome. Exactly the outcome he wanted.

The conversation started amiably. After a brief introduction, they began talking about their lives. All the events that brought them there and shaped them to be the person they were. Then, after all the pleasantries were done with, they were allowed some time to talk in private. A chance for them to bond at a more personal level. Resh waited forever for this, to ask one particular question. “What is this power called the Key of Heavenly Blessings?”

“Hmm...” the bearer fell into a deep thought. The question seemed so obvious that it never occurred to him to think about it. So it was to all the previous valedictorians that got the same chance. However, when he actually dwelled upon it, the answer was elusive. “The Key is a special power,” he began in earnest. “It allows psycheverses to be manipulated at unthinkable degrees and executes itself with near perfect efficiency. I was utterly awed when I received it. It is very...beautiful.”

That was the last push he needed. He had always aspired to become the bearer someday, but at that time he resolved to put his feelings into action. He trained very hard in order to reach the class of the strongest. It was not long until his chance to prove his worth came. A year later, it was time to choose a new bearer.

___

It was no small ordeal to Resh, as he was up against more experienced members of the clan harboring the same aspirations. The raw simplicity with which a bearer was chosen only made it more challenging, for his psycheverse was not one geared for direct confrontations. However, against all odds, he triumphed. He still remembered how ecstatic he was upon the announcement of his victory. He was too excited to sleep that day despite the fatigue; finding it hard to believe that it was finally time for him to bear that power. He promised himself that he would become a bearer worthy of the ideals he held dearly. He was blind to all other privileges that came with it; influence and wealth meant nothing. All he saw was the power called the Key of Heavenly Blessings.

The ritual for transferring the power onto him was to take place deep underground, at the most important site for the clan. As the next bearer, he would spend the next few years at the august palace, carrying out his duties. The thought made him wonder, how long would that be? He realized that he never knew what determined the timing for a new bearer to be chosen, only that the method was a combat tournament. He remembered three bearers before him; there was no pattern he could discern from how long they lasted. It also seemed rather odd that the previous bearer never joined the next tournament. Before he could dwell on the matter further, the lift he was in stopped and the door before him opened, showing him a long, white hallway. Despite the eerie lack of mana in the air within the palace, the aura emanating from the room at the end was otherworldly. With nervous steps he made his way there.

Two women clad in white opened the door upon his arrival. Inside the room he saw the Elders, the heads of the three noble families of the clan. They also served as the advisors of the bearer of the Key and oversaw the Sacred Coliseum in choosing a new one. They were standing around an orb that contained the mark of the Key. Resh was so entranced by it that it took him a while to realize he had not greeted the Elders, and duly apologized. Fortunately they were graceful about it, and proceeded to explain about the ritual and possible effects it might have on the bearer. After confirming that Resh was ready for the ritual, they invited him to hold the orb with his left hand. He did as instructed, and in the moment he learned that the orb was called Infel Bale, and it was used to contain the Key temporarily as a new bearer was chosen. Assuming such a transfer of knowledge to be normal in the situation, he nodded to the Elders to move to the next step of the ritual. They did so unsuspectingly, assuming that the sudden change in Resh’s aura was only due to him adjusting to the Infel Bale, and initiated the transfer. The orb shone bright red and was scorching hot. Fortifying his hand with mana, Resh held on; it felt as if the orb was shoving the Key into him.

“How do you feel?” one of the Elders asked him as the ritual was finished. From that moment he was the rightful bearer of the Key of Heavenly Blessings. Resh lifted his left hand and stared at the mark. “How do I feel?” He could not find the answer to that. The sensation of a large existence linking itself with his internal world was a curious one. At the same time, torrents of knowledge flowed into him, about the powers at his disposal, the details of their execution and many others. All the things he never encountered before but could mysteriously grasp at the first thought. He was speechless; simultaneously awed and repulsed. Within the torrent there was an image that seared itself on his memory. A chained sphere containing a dark shack. Inside it, a man laid unconscious before a contraption Resh could not quite make out. The back of his right hand glowed with a blue mark that Resh had never seen, but knew all too well.

“Are you fine, Resh Kierre?” the other Elder asked out of concern. “The Key forms a direct link with the psycheverse of its bearer and it is common for new bearers to feel overwhelmed. It will subside before long.”

“I have something I want to ask,” Resh said, all traces of a smile disappeared from his face. “Let me see the Seal of Forbidden Vault.”

“What? How do you...!” All the three Elders were taken by surprise. A dispute followed and Resh was forced to leave. He never spoke of what happened and went into despair at the thought of having to live bearing such a terrifying power. The Key, as if having a will of its own, continued to show him the same view of the man in the sphere. Resh spent the sleepless night haunted by that image, particularly of the blue mark.

Days later, Resh left his homeland. Since the ritual, the High Council made multiple attempts to silence him and cover up what had happened. The last straw was their failed ritual to forcibly remove the Key from him. It was then that he decided that the clan was corrupt to the core and swore to take it upon himself to change that fact.

___

Resh settled down in a village on the other side of the world. There existed records from the ancient world and he was convinced that was what he needed to find a way forward. However, those records were sealed away and for him to access them, he had to first acquire the knowledge to open it. Fortunately, the villagers were helpful in that regard, as they too were wishing to walk down the path of arcane wizardry.

Six months had passed since Resh began his journey. He was stuck with only a thin layer of magical film between him and the knowledge he so desired. He was flipping through his notes inside the village library, trying to find a hint to break through, when a girl with straight sapphire hair, several years younger, approached him. He noticed that she was the same girl who had been watching him from a distance for the last few days.

She stopped midway and went back to where she was, apparently thinking that it was a mistake.

Resh sighed, his focus was completely ruined. Her intent stare was too conspicuous and after she tried to approach him, she was impossible to ignore. He looked at her and saw her trying to avert her gaze. He liked her reaction. He took the book he was reading and went to her table. She looked shocked by his approach but chose to stay. He sat in front of her and introduced himself. “I’m Resh, one of the students here. Do you have any business with me?”

“U-um...I’m Lymsleia, one of the Priestesses here...” she introduced herself, flustered. Resh had already known that, as any student coming to the village would recognize the attire of a Priestess. That said, even from such a close distance, her aura still felt very weak. That seemed out of place; someone who was barely stronger than a child in his clan would be appointed a Priestess, the second highest position in a clan that was said to be his equal. He dismissed the thought when she continued, “I’m just a bit intrigued by you...”

“...yes?” Resh asked, it was unexpected. “Can you tell me why?”

“A-are you sure?” Lymsleia asked hesitantly. “This might offend you, so...”

“It’s okay. Please tell me,” Resh requested. “I want to know.”

Lymsleia stared into his earnest eyes, still hesitating to elaborate. Resh did not say anything and simply nodded, urging her. “You’re...different from the other students. You’re hiding a very painful secret...and you’re here solely because of that...”

Resh could not believe his ears. He tried the hardest he could to keep it hidden even from himself. He kept telling himself that there was nothing sad with his goals and he was just trying to fix a magic that went wrong, an everyday occurrence among magicians. But when she pointed it out directly, he could not stop his tears. “How...d-did you know?”

“It happens to be one of the areas I’m good at...” Lymsleia answered, looking calmer than she was before. “I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to pry into you, it’s just that I felt something strange from your aura and got curious...”

“I’m sorry Priestess, but this is none of your business,” Resh said, closing the book in front of him. “I need to leave.” He then walked out of the library.

His aura conveyed his sorrow more clearly than anything else. As he left, Lymsleia became more concerned with him, and that was enough for her to end up diving deeper into his psyche, against the wishes of both of them.

___

When Resh came to the library the next day, there was a High Mage there. It was a rare sight, as there would be nothing of interest for them in a mere school library. Did something happen? Thinking it was not related to him, he walked ahead to his usual spot. Much to his surprise, the mage approached him.

“Resh Kierre,” the mage’s voice was firm. “I came under the orders of Priestess Lymsleia Warce. She wishes to speak with you.”

“What business does a Priestess have with a starting student?” he feigned ignorance.

“I prefer not to say that here,” he said while putting a file in front of him. It was dated a week ago. “Please take a look.”

Resh opened the file and was shocked to see the header of the first page. It all fell into place. “I see. Am I to be deported now?”

“I only said that Priestess Lymsleia wishes to see you. Please follow me.”

Resh sighed and followed him to the palace. As he was escorted to Lymsleia’s room, the mage said to him, “Still, I must say that I am amazed by your camouflage magic. I could not see through it. At this rate you will be able to enter the great library soon.”

“I hope so,” Resh said indifferently, his mind was focused on how he could be allowed to remain in this village when an arrest warrant from his clan was among the contents of the file.

“We have arrived. Please come in,” the mage said to him as he opened the large door. Once Resh was inside, he closed the door from the outside and left the room.

Resh looked ahead to the end of the hallway and saw Lymsleia waiting for him. When he arrived at her desk, she offered, “Please, come here and take a seat. Formalities are unnecessary.” Though it still felt weak, her aura was astute.

Resh took the seat on the opposite side of the table. Defensive from having been discovered as a criminal, he dispelled the camouflage magic and showed her the mark. “Yes, I am bearing the Key of Heavenly Blessings and wanted by the Kierres for the removal of an important object. Would you prefer me to leave your clan right now?”

Lymsleia shook her head. Now that he was desperate and she knew about his secret, he looked all the more forlorn to her. “No, you don’t need to leave. I just want to speak with you, that’s all.”

“You want to talk me into surrendering? So much for the Warces being open to all wishing to walk down the path of wizardry!” Resh was getting even more agitated against her gentle tone. “I’m sorry, that won’t happen. If you want to give me up, you’ll have to first bring me down.”

“Please Resh, calm down. I have no intention of making you surrender and neither do I wish to arrest you for them. In fact, I was the one who ordered that this matter never get outside of the palace. This has nothing to do with the clans. Lymsleia Warce wishes to speak with Resh Kierre. Is that too much to ask?”

“I apologize,” Resh yielded, her tears managed to douse his rage. Looking at her trembling figure, he realized how cruel a thing he had done. She was indeed very weak and yet he exposed her to the brunt of his hostility. “What do you want to talk about?”

“Have you managed to enter the library?” she asked, referring to the archive that Resh sought to enter. “I was told that your knowledge of magic is quite good.”

“Unfortunately, not yet,” Resh answered. “I still need to study more. Why do you ask?”

“You said that your sorrow is n-none of my business...” Lymsleia said, looking into his eyes. “I want to tell you that is not true.”

“I’m sorry, but it really is none of your business, Priestess,” Resh politely shook his head.

“Even if I tell you that I know it in full detail? About how you fought all your life for the magic called the Key of Heavenly Blessings, only to find out that it was not the beautiful power you so revered? That you are here only to fix the things you find wrong?”

Resh was red from the shock. He was sure that he told no one about his objective. His research had not even started yet, as the seal around the library remained impenetrable to him. Therefore it was impossible for her to know by accessing the records of his study. “H-how could you...” was all that came out of his mouth.

“Your aura contains your sorrow. I simply read it.”

“How? I know that it’s possible to read the feelings of others from their aura, but not knowledge...”

Lymsleia materialized a white book in her hands. Looking at Resh with a sad smile, she said, “I am a bearer of forbidden magic too.”

Resh let out a deep sigh. “Can I ask you not to tell anyone about this? This is my fight and I don’t want to get anyone else involved.”

“I want to help you, Resh,” Lymsleia said. “I understand how you feel. Let me help you correct that magic. My power will prove to be very useful to you.”

“No doubt it will be, but I decline,” Resh shook his head. “This is the deepest secret of our clan. If a Priestess is involved, it can easily become a war. That’s the last thing I want.”

“But Resh, you don’t know what it’s like inside the library,” Lymsleia pushed on. “It won’t be easy for you...”

“I know and I’m prepared to dedicate the rest of my life to this. I’m thankful that you take the risk to protect my rights to study here, but I can’t let you do any more. I’ll work alone.”

Resh left the room and requested to return to the student dormitory. Lymsleia could only look on, the words that would change his mind eluded her.

___

Another month passed before Resh was able to unlock the seal to the great archive. He entered it with excitement, thinking that he was finally able to start his research. However, he was shocked to find out that unlocking the seal was only the first and simplest challenge. While he could overcome the traps inside satisfactorily, there was little he could do about how the archive of the ancient world was written in utterly alien languages. He spent a whole week inside, barely able to understand the content of a single book from the diagrams it contained. Upon confirming that the book was describing a form of magic unrelated to his pursuit, he left the place discouraged. He was impatient, and at the rate he was progressing, it was doubtful that he would encounter any material that would be relevant to his quest.

“How’s the library?” Lymsleia asked when he returned to the village that day. She was giddy, having waited for this chance the moment she got news of his entrance.

Resh looked at her in frustration. He knew that she was already aware of what he was thinking but talked about it anyway. “It takes me forever just to decide if a given book is relevant. It doesn’t help that there are infinitely many more that aren’t.”

Lymsleia walked closer, unable to contain the swirl of excitement inside her. “I can read all the books inside, even if they’re written in a language I’ve never seen. It’s one of my powers. This is just the kind of help that you need, Resh. Let me join you.”

Resh was silent. She was right, such an ability would be a great boost to his quest. At the same time, he hesitated. He did not want to bring her, and consequently her clan, into the affairs of his. “No. As I said, you’re a Priestess.”

“It’s fine,” Lymsleia was calm in her certitude that the path she chose was right. She had the feeling that this was what it would come down to the moment she decided to look deeper into his sorrow. She had known about it and she could no longer live as if she did not. Even if it was not her affair, as a wizard herself she could not find it in her to allow such a magic to exist. “From tonight, I’m no longer a Priestess. I’ll be just Lymsleia, a person who loves the rich world of wizardry.”

“What? How could you...” Resh was shocked. “You can’t do that just for this!”

“But I did,” Lymsleia’s smile was beaming. “Even if I don’t join you, my resignation can’t be reversed. I told them that I know a terrible secret of your clan and chose to resign to prevent the possibility of a war. So if you leave me out of your quest, I’ll have nowhere to be, Resh. I’ll be very depressed!”

“You’re crazy, Lymsleia,” Resh sighed. “What did they say about it? They didn’t demand you to reveal that secret?”

“Only the gist of it, to two other Priests. Please don’t worry, I assure you they’re trustworthy. I’ll introduce you to them later. Anyway, with their support the High Priest agreed to continue letting us do our research freely, under the condition that all my social privileges are removed. From tonight I’m no different from any other foreign students; I won’t even have Warce to my name anymore. I ask you once again, please let me help you, Resh. Or else I would’ve made all this sacrifice for nothing.”

Resh sighed. “I give up. You’re on the team, Lymsleia.”

“Thank you very much, Resh,” Lymsleia said, bowing in sincere gratitude. “By the way, because of a pact I made, my mana supply is small and I’m unable to use almost all normal forms of magic. Which is to say, physically I’m very weak and I’ll be counting on you to protect me as we venture deeper into the library.”

“I’ll protect you. Leave it to me,” Resh nodded confidently. “Though...why would you make such a pact? It sounds like a terrible one.”

“Well...it was in the first book I discovered inside the library so I was very excited...” Lymsleia answered with a blush. “Besides, this ability to read everything else inside was thanks to that, and this is also how I read into you. It’s not that bad...not to mention there’s this little thing about it...”

“What?”

“That’ll stay a secret for now,” Lymsleia’s blush was getting redder as she said that. “By the way, please call me Lym from now on, Resh.”

“Uh, okay Lym...” Resh nodded in confusion.

___

Resh looked at his son and saw his tears dropping on his head. With Lymsleia’s help he was able to skip years of work and went directly into his research. That was also the happiest moment in his life. While trying to confront his despair, he found both hope and love. In his hands was the proof of that. She named him Aize, carefully chosen to carry the meaning of both their names.

It was six months ago that they completed their research. The framework necessary to correct all that was wrong was ready following the successful experiments they conducted. All that remained was for them to install it on the current system and for that purpose it was necessary to be present on site. Resh was elated. He wanted to return as quickly as possible to explain his findings to the High Council. Even if they would understandably disagree at first, he was sure that they would understand that his solution was the more desirable one, for it had all the advantages of the old system without its weaknesses.

However, a nasty surprise quickly proved him wrong. They were ambushed by seven elite hunters sent by the clan to capture him. With his wife and son to protect, Resh could not afford to engage them, fearing the risk of his family getting caught up in the battle. Running away was his only choice. Unlike him, the hunters only had the mission to focus on and they were more than ready to use any means available to them. There were many times when they tried to take Lymsleia and Aize hostage or attack them. In order to protect his loved ones, Resh had to go beyond his limit and it was chipping away at his life. He hated his powerlessness. He may have been the student with the highest magical prowess, but talent meant nothing to him. In such circumstances, all he wished for was enough power to protect those dearest to him.

___

At last, it was time for the inevitable. The hunters were able to trap them and Resh was left with no other choice. Even if he barely had any power left, the only escape route available was one drilled through his enemies. He closed his eyes for a moment, strengthening his resolve. “Lym...please make sure you and Aize are safe. I love you.”

Lymsleia shook her head, tears flowed down her cheeks. She also hated her powerlessness. “If I knew it would come to this, I would...”

“No,” Resh interrupted her, knowing what she wanted to say. “Don’t say that. You made the right choice,” he said, referring to their little secret. “Aize is our hope.”

“Yes,” Lymsleia nodded in agreement. “Please win, Resh. I love you.”

Resh nodded and leapt ahead, rushing into the last battle of his life.

___

It was not a battle with a chance of victory. Even if he would without a doubt emerge victorious in a one on one battle, there were seven enemies. To make his odds worse, he was wounded and his mana supply was greatly diminished. Resh could not remember how the battle went. All he remembered was that at some point he stopped thinking entirely and rampaged across the battlefield. Letting his powers run berserk was the same as slowly killing himself, but that was the only option he had left. Even that was not enough. The hunters were able to take advantage of an opening and delivered a finishing blow.

“So I’ve failed...” Resh thought as the black beam crept closer to him. He had no strength left to avoid it. Curiously, as he resigned himself to death time seemed to pass much more slowly. “Ah well...at least if I die, it’s a damn pain to them too...” he smiled slightly, glad that the Key of Heavenly Blessings remained with him until the bitter end. “Sorry, Lym, Aize...I’m unable to protect you two...”

That was when Lymsleia entered the gap between him and the beam. In the smallest fraction of a second, she was smiling. She took the attack in his stead and was fatally injured as a result.

“Wha...” Resh looked at Lymsleia lying before him. “L-Lym, w-why...!?”

With the remaining life in her, Lymsleia forced herself to caress his cheek one last time. “You...can’t die here. Your life is precious, Resh...” So she passed away protecting the person dearest to her.

Resh roared, his eyes were in the color of rage and despair. He saw a vision of himself in a pitch black world. “The Key of Heavenly Blessings, if I was ever a worthy bearer, then as compensation for everything I have lost, please grant me this wish. I will pay any price. Let my son be safe.”

The hunters watched with caution, for the light from the mark of the Key was blinding. At the same time Resh’s aura greatly intensified, its hostility could be felt even by the earth itself. When it occurred to them to abort the mission, it was already far too late.

When Resh came to, Aize was completely unharmed on the ground and all the hunters were no more. His internal world was in complete ruin. Only the mark remained on his left hand.

___

“So this is where you are,” a voice was heard from the entrance of the small cave. “Even in that state you managed to travel so far...admirable, Resh.”

Having been brought back into reality by the voice, Resh quickly turned his gaze towards the entrance and saw a man he knew well, his senior in high school. He was a strong fighter, and one extremely dedicated to his duty. “It’s you now huh...”

“I don’t need to tell you why I’m here,” the slender man said in a firm, low voice. “Please, Resh. You’re in no state to run and I’d rather not hurt you.”

Resh stared silently at him. He chose to accept his fate, including the fact that his senior was sent to arrest him. At least, it allowed him a chance at salvation. “I understand. But senior, before I surrender myself...can I ask you to promise one thing?”

“Depends,” the man replied honestly. “Say it.”

“My son here, can you please...?” Resh asked, showing Aize to his senior. “He’s not involved in this...he deserves better, senior.”

Thus began the story of the Kierre clan.
