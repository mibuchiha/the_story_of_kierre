# The Story of Kierre

### A. A.

# Part 1

Although the skies remained as bright as ever, the strong gale meant that the weather was anything but peaceful. However, to the citizens of Ayulsa city, it was just another Monday. Surrounded by a protective barrier, Ayulsa - a city housing less people than its size would suggest - was divided into five different sectors. Four of roughly equal size, and a smaller central one. The four sectors were all with their own inner towns and residential areas, with no obvious distinction between them.

Magical trains were sliding smoothly on faint tracks of light, carrying passengers from one point to another. There were also vehicles of varying shapes both on the streets and in the air, driven by those impatient with the public means of transportation. In one house located in a residential area near the edge of the West sector, a lean man in his mid-thirties was heading to his daughter’s room, reminding her it was time for school.

“It’s already seven. Where’s Aize, Mika?” Shenal asked with a gentle voice. “You shouldn’t be late.”

“I’ll go get him now!” she said from her room. “Geez, he’s so helpless without me!” she grumbled while hastily finishing her make-up. She posed in front of the mirror and chuckled. Then she rushed out of her room, heading to the next one.

“Hey Aize! It’s time for school!” Mika said as soon as she barged into the room.

Seconds passed in silence before Aize finally noticed Mika. “Hmm...? It’s time already?” his attention still glued on the book written with ancient scripts.

“Geez, you’re always like that. It’s time, so hurry up, okay?” Mika said, coming close to him. “We wouldn’t want to be late.”

“Yeah yeah, let’s get going...” Aize said, taking a bag beside him. He opened it; there were two books inside, both written in languages different from each other. He put the book he was reading - written in yet another language - beside them and it disappeared, leaving a faint presence in the space it once was. Mika was looking at him intently, completely aware of what he was doing.

“You don’t have to hide it, you know. Only I’m here with you,” Mika said after a while, looking somewhat down. She never liked how Aize tended to hide his dematerialization sequence, going as far as keeping the other books in the bag materialized so as to pretend that they were normal books rather than magical artifacts. Tapping into one’s psycheverse should have been the most natural thing for all members of the Kierre clan. Yet, for reasons beyond his control, that was never the case for him.

“Sorry Mika. I know only you’re here, but it’s like a habit...” Aize said, patting the girl beside him. Her deep rosewood hair felt soft, and he loved it.

Mika loved it too, but she was too embarrassed to keep enjoying it. Hurriedly she pushed his hand aside and stood up. “I-I’ll make you stop hiding your library like that someday! Let’s go!”

“Yeah, yeah,” Aize followed her, bringing the bag with him. He smiled watching the back of the thirteen years old girl in front of him - the person closest to him - Mika Kierre.

Aize hated to go to crowded places. Due to his introversion he disliked standing out, and his hair color made him do exactly that. Everyone around him had red hair - one shade or the other - and his was dark sapphire. School was therefore painful for him, his memory of it was either getting picked on or being ostracized. It was made tolerable only thanks to Mika, who was humming cheerfully next to him as they left the station together.

“Say, Aize, don’t you feel excited somehow?” Mika suddenly started a conversation as they crossed the school gate. “I sure am!”

“About what?” he asked back, wondering if she noticed he was thinking of her.

“There will be a big battle tomorrow, and then we’ll have our first psycheverse test on Sunday!” Mika was trembling in excitement. “This has to be the most thrilling week of our life!”

“Other students are gonna be mad at you. They’re so worried and you act as if it’s nothing,” Aize shrugged. Inside, he was relieved that Mika did not seem to notice. Getting into the conversation, he continued, “Oh well, I know what you can do, of course you’ll ace it...”

“Ehehe...thanks, Aize!” Mika said, facing him with a sweet smile. “By the way, what are you gonna show during the test?”

“Hmm...I don’t know actually,” Aize answered honestly. “You know how mine is like...ouch!” Before he knew it he felt a flick on his forehead.

“That won’t do! You must think something up! I want you to ace it too!” Mika yelled angrily. Then suddenly her expression changed into a meek one. “Because you know, we must always be in the same class...”

“Right,” Aize nodded, happy to see that the question also mattered to her. He had several options in mind, but as they all involved traditional magic in some manner, he was unsure if they would count as demonstrations of the powers of the psycheverse. “I will think about it and ask Ms. Rikka some questions.”

“Yay! That’s my Aize alright!” Mika was happy to hear that. She ended up snuggling up against him all the way to their class.

___

Fifteen minutes until the first bell, and class 5 - 2 was as rowdy as usual. There were students talking and playing everywhere.

“Hey, Naga’s gonna duke it out with Fayrs tomorrow! What’s your bet?” a boy asked his friend as they were playing cards.

“Tsk, what a no-brainer. As if a pretty wimp like Fayrs has a chance against Naga’s power,” he answered mockingly, to him it was never a question.

“Haha, I think so too. Fayrs’ psycheverse is cool alright, but Naga’s just too much...” he shook his head as if pitying him. “Dragons, phoenixes, name your beast, he got it. No one’s able to handle that.”

“I’ll still watch it though. What’s more fun than watching carnage?” he grinned. “Poor Fayrs, but being the Key is no easy stuff.”

Just around that time Aize and Mika walked into the class. “Oh, enter the blue boy. Nice dye eh?” he asked as soon as he saw them. It caught the attention of everyone in the class, as if shocked by the sharp tone of the question.

Aize just ignored him and walked straight to his seat, he was used to it. Mika however, did not take it as well as him.

“Hey you!” Mika pointed her finger at his nose and yelled. “Let me remind you that Aize’s hair color is completely natural! What, are you jealous or something, redhead?”

“Huh? What’s your problem!?” the boy snapped back at her. “You’re a redhead too!”

“And? Unlike you, I don’t have any problem with Aize’s hair at all!” All the other classmates were watching their little quarrel. Mika had often became the source of noise in the class, being one of the more outspoken students. Many students also knew she hated seeing Aize being shown signs of discrimination, so the scene was nothing unusual to them. Some had begun to even find it entertaining. “I even love it! It looks so silky, it feels soft, smells nice, patting Aize’s hair is really fun! Hmph! You’re totally jealous of him!”

“Damn you Mika...” Aize looked down, blushing. “Must we really do this every other week?” Aize couldn’t bear the stares directed at him. He could even hear some students - girls - chuckling.

“Wha...n-no!” the bully desperately denied Mika’s baseless, yet accurate accusation. “W-why would I be jealous at some half-breed!?”

“What? That’s saying too much, prick!” Mika shouted, getting even angrier. “Apologize to Aize now!”

“No way, it’s all true!” he shouted back, refusing to yield. “What’s your problem!? Is he your boyfriend or something?”

“Exactly, so it is my problem!” Mika declared. “Apologize to him now!”

Aize could not fathom how Mika could say that as if it was fact, considering that it was never even brought up until that moment.

“Why would I? Don’t think I’m scared just because your psycheverse output is stronger!” the bully refused to back down.

“Oh fine then, let’s settle this the easy way,” Mika shrugged and opened a portal next to her. She reached in to take a ring out. Others could only see half her hand disappearing into another dimension, but of course everyone there knew exactly what was going on. “You’re gonna apologize if you lose, got it?”

The mana spike from Mika activating her psycheverse quickly snapped Aize back to reality. He sighed; it was wrong on so many levels that he did not know what to say. He inserted his hand into his bag, materialized a particularly thick book and whacked Mika’s head with it. “Stop it, Mika. That’s enough already.”

“Ehh why?” Mika asked, the portal was closed as soon as she took her hand out to rub her head. “They were picking on you, I don’t like that.”

“Even so, involving the psycheverse in this is too much. You know I always ignore them...” Aize took her hand and pulled her to their seats. “Still, thanks.”

“Ehehe...look at me when you say that Aize,” she said happily. Then she turned back to the boy and with her tongue out, shouted, “You should just assemble a team called Kierre 666 nm-ers or something, redhead mania! Hmph!”

“Uh shut it, class is starting,” Aize said and made her sit down on her seat. Then he went to the next seat and sat down sighing.

___

Rikka Kierre, the homeroom teacher, entered class 5 - 2 and it gradually lost the chaotic atmosphere it had minutes ago. Seconds passed and all students were properly seated. From their attentive look one could easily tell that she was respected and loved by her students.

“Good morning, everyone,” she began, scanning over the class. “No absences, I see. As you all know, this is the last day of primary school for you. On Sunday you all will be taking your first psycheverse test that will determine your class in junior high. Those who are ready raise your hand!”

About half of the students raised their hands. “You’ll be surprised, Ms. Rikka!” the boy that quarreled with Mika said cheerfully. “And you too, Mika!” he added with a grudging look on his face.

“Yeah right! I’ll plow you down this Sunday, just wait!” Mika yelled back. Aize just sighed and mumbled, “It’s a practical exam, Mika. You can’t beat him up...”

“There, there. Mika, Berie, don’t fight. And there will be no battles in the test, you just have to demonstrate what you can do with your psycheverse,” Rikka explained.

“Tch, they really should change the format,” Mika grumbled, looking very annoyed.

“Ahaha...” Rikka had to change the topic to prevent it from getting worse. “What about the others that didn’t raise their hand? You have less than a week for it, you know?”

The students began explaining their troubles. Rikka catered to them one by one, giving advice on what they could do to improve themselves for the test. Aize was the only one silent through the whole session. It was not because he did not enjoy the class, however, he simply had nothing to say. Out of boredom he took a book from his bag and started reading it.

An hour passed as Rikka was teaching her students the many ways of the psycheverse. Just as she thought, a demonstration using her own was the best way to help the students understand their own. Rikka was a unique teacher in that respect; she loved seeing her students’ inner world and showing hers to them. The free study period had plenty of back and forth, with students practicing and asking for advice. Mika enjoyed the time tremendously, liking the chance to show off various items from her internal world.

“Okay, let’s do some revision now! We need to do our best for the written exam too, even if it’s not as crucial as the practical one,” Rikka said to the class, noting from their aura that some students were beginning to overexert themselves. When they were all seated, she continued, “To start with...Marik, tell us the definition of psycheverse.”

“Yes, Ms. Rikka,” the serious-looking student stood up. “A psycheverse is a mental world that manifests in all members of the Kierre clan. Mastery of psycheverse is the ability to actualize as much as possible from deep within the mind, thus enabling us to tap into the vast powers of it.”

“That’s right. Thanks, Marik,” Rikka said, satisfied with his answer. Then she glanced at Aize to check on him. “Reading as usual huh...” she chuckled. “If only he’s more active in class. He has such a unique psycheverse too,” she said to herself. “Aize!” she raised her voice slightly to startle the boy.

“Y-yes?” Aize stiffened up from surprise. “What is it, Ms. Rikka?” At the next seat, Mika shook her head. “Geez, it’s always like this. Stupid Aize.”

“Can you explain the stages of psycheverse development?” Rikka asked, smiling.

“Um...yes,” Aize nodded and took a breath. “The initial stage is said to start at the age of five to seven, in which the psycheverse starts developing within the mind. In this stage the individual starts to become aware of the existence of their psycheverse typically through dreams or hallucinations. The second stage follows, when the individual is said to have a concrete image of their psycheverse and is able to consciously imagine it. It is also in this stage that the individual begins to be able to interact actively with their own world. This leads to the individual learning more about it and the powers available to them.”

“Mhm, good,” Rikka said, thinking about what she should ask him next. “As you know, all children born into the Kierre clan are taught about the psycheverse from age seven at school. What do you think this has to do with the development stages?”

“Uh...let’s see...” Aize looked down, somewhat uncomfortable at the stares of attention directed at him. “I think it’s timed around the beginning of the second stage. Psycheverse development can be a stressful process. The school helps with it by equipping the children with the knowledge they need as well as teachers should the aid of the family be inadequate.”

“That’s exactly it, Aize. Well done,” Rikka smiled at him. “Now, Mika, continue with the third development stage and so on, please.”

“Okay Ms. Rikka!” Mika stood up cheerfully. “Eheheh...how to say it...the third stage starts around eleven. This is when someone understands their psycheverse, which usually means that they can use its powers somehow.” After pausing for a second, Mika continued, “The fourth stage is when someone is fully comfortable with their psycheverse. One sign of this is when they can enter it physically. That’s all, Ms. Rikka!”

“Thanks a lot, Mika. You explained it very well,” Rikka praised the girl student. “The fourth stage is not too commonly discussed, as there are some that never reach it. Oh yeah, do you know that there are rumors about some people that can support others entering their psycheverse too?”

“What? Really, Ms. Rikka?” Marik stood up from surprise. “Isn’t entering your own is difficult enough?”

“Yes,” Rikka nodded, understanding Marik’s surprise. “I don’t personally know someone who can do that, though. Synchronizing your physical being with the psycheverse is challenging, so we can only imagine what it takes to support another person inside.”

Aize looked on silently as the class was stunned in amazement. Then he glanced at Mika, she did not look happy either. The look on her face was concerning.

“What about you, Ms. Rikka? You’ve reached the fourth stage right?” Berie asked. “Of course you do!”

“Haha...thanks, Berie. I can, but not for too long. Around...half an hour, I think.”

“Wow that’s amazing! My father can’t even last ten minutes inside!” Berie laughed, admiring Rikka.

“Speaking of,” the boy that was playing with Berie, Zwarn, interjected. “How long can Naga or Fayrs be in theirs?”

“Naga’s got to be forever. Just look at all the big monsters he brought out during the semis,” a boy answered. Another quickly added, to show support for his favorite contestant. “Fayrs didn’t do half bad too, he was very much in control of his.”

“Pft, let’s see how much control helps in dealing with dragons,” Zwarn sneered.

“Alright boys, that’s enough,” Rikka clapped her hand to stop the argument. “Tomorrow we will see who is the better fighter. Let’s not start a proxy duel now, okay?”

“I don’t like it,” a girl seated in the middle of the class suddenly said.

“What do you not like, Saya?” Rikka asked the girl whose yellow ribbon nicely complimented her rustic red hair. She knew that Saya was a very gentle girl, so it was understandable that she did not enjoy a discussion on battles.

“They are deciding who should be the next Key, right? Why is fighting the way to decide who leads the clan?”

“Duh, because the strongest deserves the position!” Zwarn promptly answered.

“I’m not asking you, Zwarn,” Saya replied, and looked at Rikka. “What is the Key, Ms. Rikka? What does it have to do with fights?”

“Hmm...now that you mention it...” Rikka was taken aback by the question, it was not one she put much thought into before. “I’ll have to look it up, but let’s see. Does everyone know what pairs with the Key?”

“Yep! It’s called the Seal right?” Saya answered quickly. “I only know the name though...”

“The Seal, indeed. Their full names are the Key of Heavenly Blessings and the Seal of Forbidden Vault. In some sense, they are the opposites of each other. For example, the Key is said to possess the power that blesses all of us Kierre clan members. The Seal on the other hand is entrusted with a holy pilgrimage to absolve us Kierres of our sins. The method of choosing who will take up the position is different too. For the Seal, not much is known, and the Key, as we all know, the Sacred Coliseum. The tournament whose final round is tomorrow, between Fayrs and Naga.”

“It isn’t held periodically, right? Why’s that, Ms. Rikka?” Berie asked.

“From what I’ve heard it’s the Key that decides the time to choose its new bearer,” Rikka answered. “I don’t know much more than that.”

“So we still don’t know why they must fight for it,” Saya grumbled. “Mama said fights aren’t good.”

“That’s the tradition, Saya,” Rikka said with a smile of resignation. “I think it’s because the powers are directly related to the psycheverse and the simplest way to judge someone’s mastery is by gauging his battle prowess.”

Aize stared out of the window. More than the Key, it was the Seal that he wanted to know about. “What sins?” he silently wondered. He saw no point in asking however, for he had been searching for the answer in any book he could get his hands on since the first time it was mentioned in history lessons, and could find no more on the matter.

They were on their way back home. Mika did not want to use the station, so they were walking. While it was no issue to either of them thanks to mana enhancement, she was silent all the way and Aize found it worrisome. She kicked a pebble as they passed through a park and let out a depressed sigh.

“What’s wrong? You haven’t been talking much since Ms. Rikka’s class.”

Mika looked around, making sure no one was paying them any attention. Then she asked in a whisper-like voice, “Aize, do you think the fourth stage is as great as they make it seem?”

“I don’t know, to me it’s just something you’ll surely reach sometime in life...” Aize answered likewise, choosing his words very carefully. “What about it?”

“...let’s go home, Aize!” Mika abruptly rushed ahead to their house.

“What the...hey, wait!” Aize said as he started running after her.

“Hmm...?” Shenal was surprised to see the two kids running full speed to the house. He put the watering can down and went to greet them. “Hey, what are you two up to now?”

“Haa...I-I’m home, Papa...” Mika said, panting. Aize was right behind her, he managed to close the gap somehow. “Uh...I’m home too, Uncle...” he was breathing heavier than Mika.

“Welcome home, you two. Why are you running?” Shenal was curious.

“I don’t know...” Aize said, looking at Mika. “Mika suddenly dashed, so I followed her...” Shenal’s expression showed that he knew that it was Mika who dashed first.

“Hmph! Just wait, stupid Aize!” Mika said, before quickly turning to Shenal. “More importantly, Papa, when did you reach the fourth stage?”

“Fourth stage of...?” Shenal asked back, not getting his daughter.

“Psycheverse!” Mika said, impatient for an answer. “When was it?”

“Ahh...you mean when I was first able to enter my own?” Shenal finally understood her. “I think I was twenty one...the normal age range. Why?”

“Can you let others in?” Mika pressed on. Aize was totally silent, but his intent stare showed that he was just as interested in Shenal’s answer.

Shenal smiled, finally getting where the topic came from. “You discussed that in school huh? Yep, people that can do that are rare. You have to train very hard to reach that level.”

“But can you, Uncle?” Aize was also getting impatient.

“I can. There are restrictions, like one person at a time, and not for too long. But yes, I am at the fifth stage, if you will,” Shenal said while patting them. “I’m still training myself though.”

“I see...Papa’s amazing,” Mika smiled at him. “Berie said his father can’t do that.”

“I think anyone can with enough training. Of course, whether or not one has a need to do so is a different question,” Shenal said, taking the water can to continue watering. “Go in, the lunch is on the table. Heat it up and eat.”

“Alright!” Mika replied energetically. “Okay Uncle,” Aize also smiled, amazed at Shenal’s ability and glad that Mika was back to her usual self.

That night, somewhere near the edge of Ayulsa, the seventeen years old Fayrs Kierre was basking in the starlight. Despite the grand view before him, his attention was focused on the screen floating an arm’s length away from him. It was a recording of Naga’s semifinal battle from a week ago. It began much like his other battles in the Coliseum; him unleashing a number of beasts from his psycheverse. For all his other battles that was all he needed to do; one beast was too much to handle, two overwhelming, and victory would come before long. Only in this one he had to do somewhat more, leading to the only recording that Fayrs found worth watching, and one he had been watching over and over.

Naga’s opponent had a psycheverse that involved some kind of glue, which he matched with wind magic. Certainly the humbler kind of psycheverses, but that made him reaching the stage he did all the more impressive. While it was clear that Naga was in an entirely different bracket, perhaps even to the man himself, he did distinguish himself by being the only opponent that managed to get past the horde of raptors coming at him to deliver a hit at Naga. However, that only served to demonstrate that the usual wisdom of directly attacking the summoner did not quite apply to him. Surrounding his limbs with flames to render the glue ineffective, Naga effortlessly turned the momentum of the striker against him and threw him back where he came from, with the raptors freed from their binding in a similar way. There was no second chance; another horde of raptors promptly finished the battle.

“This guy’s trouble,” Fayrs once again concluded on the man twenty years his senior. It was clear Naga knew how to fight, and the summoning was only to settle the match the easy way. Who knew how much more he had under his arsenal? At the same time, Fayrs could not deny his excitement. While he knew of many strong members of the clan, as the heir of one of the three noble families they were on his side. Naga on the other hand was not.

Fayrs signaled for the video to be stopped and opened the notes given to him about Naga. It made a clear mention that the beasts he saw were nowhere near Naga’s limits, and that those on the level of giant dragons - any one of which was enough to ruin any town - should be expected. Truly a man directly connected to the World of Wings and Scales. Would the light of the Radiant Valley be enough against such a foe?

Fayrs shook his head. There was no point in doubting himself after having gone so far. He had his reasons to fight. One last hurdle to overcome and he would become the Key. He was so close to that dream and he would not be his own worst enemy. As he was thinking that, his eyes darted to the skies and he finally found it in himself to admire the stars. “What a fine view,” he thought; the lights were reminding him of his own. He materialized a handful of shining crystals and threw it up to add to the glitter. When they fell to the ground, Fayrs fired laser rays upwards with them, in various beautiful patterns.

Little did Fayrs know that he was not the only one enjoying the view in that field that night. Just outside the seal surrounding the area was his father, Witr Kierre, who wanted to check on his son before his most important challenge thus far. Satisfied that Fays was doing fine, he decided to leave without saying a word.

___

The path leading to the arena was rowdy. Everyone was looking forward to watching the event to come; the final match of the Sacred Coliseum. People were talking about how they thought the battle would turn out and of course, the small family of three was no different.

“Fayrs is totally gonna win...” Mika sang cheerfully as she walked in marching steps. “He’ll be the next Key for sure, right, Papa?”

“Ahaha...I wouldn’t be so sure, Mika,” Shenal patted her head. “I used to work with Naga so I know how strong he is.”

“Hmph! Fayrs is way stronger! He’s much more handsome than that geezer!” Mika pouted and turned away from her father.

“Looks have nothing to do with either strength or psycheverse mastery, Mika...” Aize muttered while looking all over the path towards the arena. It was his first time visiting the place and he was curious.

“You shut up, Aize! I want Fayrs to win so he will win!” she said, sulking.

“Yeah right, you’re always like that,” he said without caring much, used to this side of her. “Uncle, is Naga really that strong? From what I’ve seen his psycheverse lacks versatility...Fayrs should be able to ignore the big stuff and attack him directly.”

Shenal smiled at the boy. “You’re right, Aize. But think about it...if your psycheverse is like that, what would you do?”

“Equip myself with skills that help me deal with that weakness, of course,” Aize said immediately. “For example, I’d learn the techniques of close combat...ah.”

“See, you figured it out yourself. Naga’s very experienced, he has his answer to that problem.”

“Yeah...I forgot he showed some of it in the semis. So he was just never really challenged to the point of needing it much, huh...” Aize said, feeling admiration in him as he recalled Naga’s battles that he watched.

Shenal smiled at the boy. Actually Naga’s psycheverse was not as rigid as Aize thought, but Shenal chose not to tell the boy about it. He should get to see it himself in the battle to come.

“Hmph, all this Naga talk...come on Papa, Fayrs must at least has some kinda chance right?” Mika joined in, disliking how Aize looked like he was sure Fayrs would lose.

“Hmm...what I can say is if what he showed in the semifinals is his all, he can’t win this. But Fayrs is still young, so his growth can be unpredictable,” Shenal said honestly while smiling.

“You mean if he hasn’t improved, he’s in for a lot of pain,” Mika said, her eyes becoming teary.

“Don’t be like that, dear,” Shenal lifted the girl on his shoulder. “I do think Fayrs is amazing in his own way.”
\\\\
“R-really?” Mika asked, curiosity cheered her up. “Explain to me!”

“He’s just seventeen and he’s fighting in the Sacred Coliseum. He still has a lot to work on, but his strength is the real thing,” Shenal said, noticing Aize was also all ears on him. “It might not be this time, but I think he will surely be the Key someday.”

“Uncle, do you think he’s also like you?” Aize asked curiously. “I mean, is he able to let others enter his psycheverse?”

“I’m sure he can. I don’t think he can bring forth that much power if he’s still not fully in sync with his psycheverse,” Shenal told him. “I wasn’t capable of anything like that when I was his age. That’s one reason why I think he’s amazing.”

“Geez! I like Fayrs but I don’t like Papa saying that!” Mika yelled, going down and punching him. “Don’t belittle yourself!”

“Haha...sorry, Mika,” Shenal apologized. “I was just stating the fact. A talent like that only comes very rarely.”

“I know that, but...” Mika hugged Shenal’s arm. “Papa’s still the best for me...” Glancing at Aize, she added very softly, “And you too.”

___

It was only minutes before the final match. Fayrs was meditating in preparation. As he did so, someone knocked on the door. “Enter,” Fayrs said unsuspectingly. It was his grandfather, Isyaa Kierre. As the head of one of the three main noble families, he was also one of the members of the High Council, a group of three Elders that ruled over and protected the secrets of the Kierre clan. “Gramps.”

“You mean Your Excellency Isyaa,” he reprimanded the young man before him. “No matter. Your battle is soon. Are you ready, Fayrs?”

“I’ll be fine,” was Fayrs unenthusiastic reply. It was not from a lack of drive to win however, only from him knowing too well what was to follow.

“Victory is compulsory. The two families managed to defend the Key in previous rounds, and now it is our turn. Remember the disasters that happen when those not of the nobility are allowed to bear the Key,” Isyaa told him sternly. “We went so far as to allow you to compete instead of your father. Do not fail us.”

“I know. I will win,” Fayrs nodded. While one of those disasters Isyaa mentioned was the reason he was competing in the first place, he never believed that it had anything to do with the bearer not being a noble. He nonetheless agreed that he would be the one to bear it, for he was the only one that would be able to use it properly.

“You seem confident. Very good. Worry not, if you look like you’re not able to win, we shall back you up,” Isyaa said.

“Huh? What do you mean by that!?” Fayrs was shocked to hear him. “Back me up in a one on one battle?” he trembled, feeling like his determination was being stepped on.

“My, my...we conduct the ritual for both the Key and the Seal. Infel Bale is in our control. Do you really think we do not have some means available to us concerning the psycheverse?”

Fayrs looked down. It did not occur to him before, but yes, the tournament was a farce in a sense. The nobles did have some means available to sabotage psycheverses to some degree. This was not how he wanted to bear the Key. In a deep, low voice, he asked, “Your Excellency Isyaa, the Elder...can I ask you to not interfere? I’ll win this for sure, so...please.”

Isyaa looked at his grandson. Fayrs was never a particularly obedient one, but he had never directly opposed his elders. After careful consideration, he concluded that it was more profitable to play along and turned away. “There will be no interruption as long as you are winning.”

“Thank you very much,” Fayrs bowed to Isyaa as he left the room. After he left, Fayrs closed the door again and sat down. He materialized two crystals in his hands. “The valley is beautiful and the feelings are pure.”

There was still some time before the battle. Fayrs sent a mana pulse into the crystal in his right and it suddenly shone brighter. A laser ray was emitted from it and was then absorbed by the one in his left. Fayrs reversed the process and repeated it several times. He smiled while he did it, playing with his psycheverse made him remember that grand view.

“Now is the time we’ve been waiting for!” Fayrs heard a voice from the speaker attached to his room. He made the crystals disappear and walked out of the room. “The final match of the Sacred Coliseum is starting! Who between these two men will be the next Key of Heavenly Blessings?”

Fayrs walked calmly along the corridor. He saw Naga walking towards the stage with his ever confident look. Little wonder, for Naga’s path to the finals was an extremely smooth one. Even among the veterans he was something else. It would not be surprising for Fayrs if he was told that Naga could hold his own among the elite forces of his clan that served the noble families.

Enough with the admiration, Fayrs told himself. He was still young; talent was probably the only thing that he had more than his opponent. But he would not back down. “Bring it on, Naga!” he said, hearing his name called by the referee.
