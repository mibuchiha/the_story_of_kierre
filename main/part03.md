# The Story of Kierre

### A. A.

# Part 3

The day after the Sacred Coliseum was a slow one. All over Ayulsa, Fayrs vs Naga was a common topic. Many offered their favorite interpretation on how the battle went. For the young man, the battle was taking its toll; he fell asleep as soon as he arrived home. When he woke up eighteen hours later, he felt only headache and soreness. Any movement sent a surge of pain all over his body, so he was loath to get out of the bed. On the other hand, watching something required using magic, not pleasant given his headache. As a result, he had been staring blankly at the ceiling for over an hour, mulling over his plans for the Key he was soon to bear.

For someone slated to be a member of the High Council someday, his room was humbler than what the average member of the clan would expect. The walls were granite black, complementing the marble white floor and ceiling. His bed was at the end of the room furthest away from the entrance. The furniture was mostly dark in color. The walls were adorned with stones from the Radiant Valley, serving as both an exquisite source of light and a form of training. In his current condition they were not shining, but the room was nevertheless bright due to natural light entering from the open windows spanning the right side of the bed. The black curtains dotted with smaller pebbles in curved patterns rippled about as the wind gently blew over them.

His stream of consciousness was interrupted by a knocking sound. “Fayrs, are you awake? I’m coming in,” the familiar voice of his mother Riah was heard. Her tone gave him some idea of what she wanted to talk about. “I’m awake, Mom. The door isn’t locked. Please come in.”

Riah entered and reached for a chair by a desk in the middle of the room, but Fayrs invited her to sit beside him on the bed. She smiled and did so. “Are you feeling better, dear?”

“I’m recovering nicely,” Fayrs held her hand to assuage her worry. She had made it clear that she did not view the Coliseum favorably, and was against Fayrs competing. Therefore, watching the battle yesterday could not have been easy for her. Still, she relented, not having it in her to stand between her son and his most important wish.

“I’m glad to hear that,” Riah said, doubly so as his aura corroborated his words. “Congratulations on being the next Key, dear. We are all very proud of you.”

“That’s...good to know,” Fayrs said with half a sigh.

“You don’t seem too happy about it.”

“I’m just...thinking about a few things.”

“Would you like to share them with me?”

Fayrs looked Riah in the eye. Although more overprotective than what he would have liked her to be, on the whole she was a supportive mother. Unlike Isyaa and Witr, who Fayrs felt treated him more as an heir, Riah was genuinely concerned with his wishes and struggles. For that reason, he was comfortable sharing his thoughts with her. “Gramps spoke with me before the battle with Naga. I don’t like how he put things then.”

“What did he say?”

“The usual; that the Key must stay in the hands of the nobles,” Fayrs began. “Not the tenth time he said that, but that alone didn’t bug me. Then he said that if I couldn’t win by myself, that’d be fine, he could ensure my victory anyway.”

Fayrs did not continue, but Riah saw that he had more to say. She waited for him.

“I know it can really be done using Infel Bale, or even...ugh,” Fayrs stopped, the thought alone made him tremble with anger. He took a deep breath to gather himself and continued, “To him, all that matters is that some noble bears the Key.”

“Don’t say that, dear. Your grandfather can be harsh at times, but he only wants what he believes to be the best for the clan. You agree that the nobles get to learn more about the two powers compared to other Kierres, don’t you?”

“...I know,” Fayrs nodded. His approval of the selective education aside, Riah was right that the knowledge did provide for a degree of preparation to bear the two powers. He let out a sigh and confessed, “First Gramps said that, and then Naga let me win...I was fighting for myself the whole time, and in the end I couldn’t even get the Key with my own power. It’s frustrating.”

Riah empathized with her son, but thought he was missing the forest for the trees. She shook her head and sternly asked, “what do you need the Key for, Fayrs Kierre?”

“To help Kirana,” Fayrs’ voice was clear. Of this wish, he had not the slightest doubt.

“How do you plan to achieve that, exactly? No one in Ayulsa knows how to do it. Do you know something about the Key that the rest of us don’t?”

“...no,” Fayrs shook his head honestly. “I want to bear the Key to understand it deeper than the previous bearers, and in doing so learn of a way to help Kirana. Right now, I know nothing.”

“Then your fight begins when you start bearing the Key. So what if it’s given to you?”

Fayrs looked down silently. A few seconds passed and he shook his head, smiling. “I understand now. Thanks a lot, Mom.”

“You’re welcome, dear,” Riah gently patted her son’s head. “I trust that you can move forward no matter what. I only ask that you also take care of yourself.”

“I’ll try not to worry you so much,” Fayrs said with a smirk.

“Alright, I shouldn’t take more of your resting time,” Riah said, relieved that Fayrs seemed to be feeling better. “The transfer ritual is tomorrow...do you think you’ll be fine by then?”

“I think so. If I’m not feeling well, I’ll let you and Dad know.”

“Very good. Get to resting now. I’ll have lunch delivered to you.”

“Thanks again, Mom. I’m glad we talked about this.”

Riah waved at Fayrs and started leaving the room. After closing the door, the widest smile formed on her lips. She was elated. It had been a while since Fayrs last spoke his thoughts with her. She could not wait for night to come, so that she could tell Witr all about it.

___

That afternoon, Aize and Mika stayed home during their last free study week in primary school. They were preparing for the examination in four days. Aize spent the time studying the techniques used in the battle the day before. His desk was scattered with different books and snapshots of the match as he poured his attention on the distribution of mana in the arena, its flow from the caster to the portal and finally to the actual magic being used. Occasionally he would practice them himself, using toy spells from the books in his library that would disperse the mana back into him. In doing so he kept being reminded of how far ahead of him the combatants were, and that gave him much inspiration. At the same time, cheerful laughter could sometimes be heard as Mika was talking with Saya and a few other friends about their exam preparation and their next outing plans, among other things.

About half an hour later, the call was finished; Saya was going out with her family. That left Mika with little to do. She browsed through the entertainment catalog, but nothing caught her interest. She thought about the examination. She materialized three rings and two pendants, the options she considered going with. It did not take her long to home in on the pendant with a wolf head motif, the one emitting the most ominous aura. If she was going to demonstrate anything, it had to be challenging to be worth her while. The other four also had high mana demands, as their aura indicated, but her choice had the added advantage of possibly going berserk. That reminded her of how Naga was able to keep Diaraag under control. She wanted to be capable of something similar.

Having decided on her choice, her mind wandered in search of activity. She quickly noticed the mana pulses from the next room. What is Aize doing? Curious to find out, she tiptoed to his room, carefully hiding her presence to catch him unaware. She opened the not quite closed door and barged in. “Hey Aize, whatever are you up to?”

“Oh. Hi, Mika,” Aize said with no trace of the surprise she was hoping to see. It did not occur to her that just as she felt the mana when Aize was practicing, he felt it when she materialized the artifacts. Considering the silence that followed, he half guessed that she was heading to his room. “Gimme a moment...I’ll be done very soon.”

Her cheerful expression soured up when she saw the Fayrs vs Naga video playing on his desk. She walked to him, took the screen away, and yelled, “Geez, Aize! Fayrs vs Naga again? You watched that first thing after dinner last night! And after breakfast this morning! Are you going to study all day? Let’s play something!”

“Hey! Gimme that!” Aize reached out to get the screen back from her. Mika turned to avoid him, but her other arm coincidentally locked with Aize’s. At the same time, as he was rapidly standing up, he tripped on one foot of the bed right beside his desk. As a result, he fell and ended up pushing Mika onto his bed.

“Wha...Aize, I’m not ready...” Mika’s face turned red; she had yet to realize that it was not deliberate on his part.

The sudden shift in her tone made Aize realize what was happening, and he hurriedly went to the other end of the bed. “S-sorry, Mika! I didn’t mean to, I just fell! Honest!”

His apology in turn made Mika see how she had misunderstood the situation and she became embarrassed. She covered herself in Aize’s blanket while glaring at him. “You’re the worst! Don’t do that to a girl so suddenly, okay?”

“You’re the one who started it...” Aize mumbled, not getting why he was blamed.

It took only seconds for Mika to be back to her cheerful self. “So what were you doing with the video? Learned anything fun?”

The question perked Aize right up. “Oh, yes. I’m pretty sure Fayrs is an emitter. Naga’s a bit harder to say, but I bet he’s an enhancer.”

Emission and enhancement referred to two of several broad categorizations of magic usage. Emission-type magic involved directly manipulating mana a distance from the caster with no physical contact, such as Fayrs opening multiple portals away from himself. Enhancement on the other hand pertained to using mana to enhance existing attributes, its most elementary application being augmenting physical strength. Since most individuals were more compatible with one category over the others, it was common for example to refer to someone whose main specialty was conjuration as simply a conjurer. Of course, such labels were not rigorously determined and cultural biases played a significant role. Members of the Kierre clan were all naturally compatible with conjuration to some extent simply from having psycheverses, and as such, the label conjurer was almost unheard of in Ayulsa.

“Eh...really?" Mika was not convinced. “Fayrs being an emitter is easy to see, but Naga an enhancer? He was breathing fire and summoning left and right. Transmuter fits better, no?”

“I thought so at first too, but nope, he’s an enhancer. Gimme the video, and get the films on my desk. I’ll show you.”

“Alright,” Mika handed the screen, and reached for the transparent sheets on Aize’s desk.

When Aize got all of them, he chose the second one from the top and overlaid it on top of the screen. “This film here makes mana gradients visible as colors. Sure, we can just feel it by focusing, but it’s less tiring like this. Anyway, look here, right at the beginning.” He paused the video at when Naga summoned the first batch of the shadow wyrms. “Look at how mana is distributed around him and the portals. Fayrs’ looks better, right?”

It was subtle, but Mika agreed that the aura intensity around Naga fell more rapidly with distance compared to Fayrs. She still did not see how that made him an enhancer. “It only means he’s not an emitter. Transmutation fits him just fine too, based on what you showed.”

“Relax,” Aize continued the playback. “Let’s look at when he parried the beams. They are distracting, so we’ll filter them out.” He inserted another film between the screen and the first one.

With the help of the films, Mika noticed something was off by the end of the first close combat sequence. “Wait, Aize. Can we do that again, but slower this time?”

“Sure,” Aize rewound the video and played it at half speed. He was glad to see Mika spotting something at around the same time he did. When it came to portal manipulation they seemed to be roughly at the same level, but Naga’s physical enhancement was vastly superior.

“Mm...yep, I see what you mean now,” Mika nodded, after playing the sequence once more to convince herself she was not seeing things. As she expected, it was the same the third time around. Whenever mana was flowing inside Naga’s body, it did so with such speed and smoothness unlike anything else seen in the combat. One issue confused her, though. “Geez, he fought like he wanted to be seen as anything but an enhancer. Why do that?”

Aize stopped the video and put it aside, seeing that Mika was convinced. “No idea. Maybe it’s one of those fighting with your hands tied kinda thing?”

“Bleh. He was messing around because it was just Fayrs, huh? What a cocky old man.”

“Well, it was clear that he didn’t care much about the Key. Maybe he was in it for the fights?” Aize asked. Then, remembering what Shenal mentioned, he continued, “speaking of which, didn’t Uncle used to work with him? Wanna ask him what Naga’s like?”

“Let’s do that later. Papa’s out now, and won’t be back until late,” Mika told Aize while pouting. “You were too busy with your analysis to notice.”

“Aw come on. I had a hunch after watching the video, and I had to confirm it. To do that I had to make those films,” Aize explained. “I’m glad I did, though. Now we see just how strong Naga and Fayrs really are. I wonder if I can be that strong too someday.”

“Sheesh, power is all you care about. What a brat,” Mika complained while adjusting her position on the bed. “Why don’t you study something that actually matters for once?”

“Like what?” Aize asked, sending the books on his desk back to the library.

Mika’s face turned red. “Like...me, maybe?”

Aize blushed, he had trouble believing his ears. “U-um, Mika...what do you...”

Mika did not let him finish. She took a pillow and smooshed it on Aize’s face. “T-that was a joke, okay? Don’t take it so seriously, stupid Aize!”

Aize struggled in order to breathe. When Mika let go, he was gasping for air. That was when he realized that Mika had been sitting on him all the while. Not that he minded it, but just to see her reaction, he asked, “are we going to stay like this all day, Mika?”

“Oh, yeah,” Mika smiled coyly and went to the other side of the bed. “Hehe...sorry, Aize.”

Aize adjusted his position and returned to Mika’s invitation to play. “So, what do you want to do? Do you want to go outside?”

“Hmm...” Mika mulled on the question for a while. She had something in mind when she came to Aize’s room, but had forgotten what it was.

“You don’t want to?” Aize guessed from how she did not brighten up at the suggestion. “You prefer to stay home, because you were practicing with your artifacts earlier?”

The word practice jolted Mika’s memory. “That’s it! What do you wanna show in the exam?”

“...ah,” was Aize’s reply. A few seconds passed in silence.

“You completely forgot about it, because you were too focused on Fayrs vs Naga.”

“C-come on, it’s Wednesday! We’ve got time...” Aize averted his gaze from Mika’s stare.

“Yeah sure, if you start planning now,” Mika sighed. “Any rough ideas, at least?”

“Mmh...nothing at the moment,” Aize shrugged. “What about you?”

Mika was waiting for that question. Smugly, she replied, “Of course. It’s gonna be awesome!”

“Your idea of awesome worries me,” Aize sighed, anticipating some trouble to happen. “Remember, it’s an exam, not a battle. Don’t beat someone up.”

“Geez, I know that!” Mika retorted. “I won’t aim at anyone. It’ll be juuust a little scary. By the way, there’s something I’ve wanted to show you since a while. Wanna see?”

“You’re going to show me it here? No thanks, I like my room. Don’t destroy it.”

“No, not what I’ll be doing in the exam. Something more interesting,” Mika smiled and came closer to whisper in his ear. “I wanna show you...my psycheverse.”

Aize was silent. If he understood her correctly, it meant that Mika was not only able to enter her psycheverse, but also allow another to do the same. In other words, she was beyond the fourth stage at thirteen. While he had always known her to be much more capable than their peers, learning that she was so far ahead was still surprising. He had to confirm it with her. “How do you want to show me your psycheverse?”

“I can enter it, and I can even stay indefinitely,” Mika said, beaming with excitement to show him her internal world. “So I want to see if I can handle having someone else too. And well, the first person to go there gotta be you. You’ll come inside me, right, Aize?”

Her saying that delighted Aize, for he also wanted the same. “I’d love to, Mika.”

“Well then, what are we waiting for? Let’s go!” Mika opened up a portal between them, and the two disappeared from Aize’s room.

___

The two appeared at the center of a hall about twice the length and width of their main school hall. Around them were numerous vitrines of intricate designs, arranged in a circular pattern. Considering that they contained magical artifacts with various effects, Aize expected that the aura they emitted would be chaotic, but that was not the case. Intense, most certainly, and perhaps even forceful in some cases, but the aura felt rather like pure mana. He found that surprising; artifacts Mika materialized exuded aura very much compatible with the magic they contained. Was it because of the vitrines? Looking around, there was no window in sight, only four gigantic doors, one in each direction. Only the one to his right was open. There were also no direct sources of light. Still, the room was very bright - any brighter, and he would not have been comfortable with it. In that sense he thought that the world was much like Mika. The floor was completely draped in carpet; similar to the vitrines, there seemed to be no clear theme in its patterns, but together, there was a kind of harmony about them. Although he considered himself quite imaginative, in part thanks to being well-read, he truly thought that he had never seen - or thought of, for that matter - another view more beautiful.

Mika was watching Aize as he took it in all the while. She could tell that he liked her psycheverse, and she could not be happier. As his gaze was starting to settle, she bowed slightly and asked, “Welcome to the vault! How do you like my psycheverse?”

“I...it’s amazing...” Aize mumbled, still reeling from awe. As Mika had described how her psycheverse looked like before, he went in thinking he knew what to expect. He realized that he was nowhere near ready. Everything he saw matched her descriptions, but seeing it firsthand, or rather, being inside her, was a different experience entirely.

“Hehe...this is just the first room you know?” Mika said, puffing with pride. Seeing that Aize turned his gaze to the open door, she continued, “Do you wanna take a look?”

Aize nodded in agreement.

Mika cheerfully led the way. They had not walked twenty meters when she stopped at a display, seeing an artifact that evoked fun memories. “Aize, do you remember this ring?”

“Lemme see...” Aize said, coming closer. He recognized the ring Mika was pointing at. “Ah, that one. It opens up a bounded space, right?”

“Yep!” Mika nodded. “It filters out noise too, so it’s very convenient! Saya used to borrow it when she wanted to sleep with her dad, but didn’t want to deal with his snores.”

“That was a couple of years ago, right?” Aize asked, recalling the time when they were in the lower primary school. Most children their age were barely starting to temporarily materialize objects from their psycheverses at the time, but Mika was already going around lending magical artifacts from hers. Not that Aize knew that many children to compare with, but he had a feeling that as far as psycheverse development went, Mika was exceptional. He knew of no other as gifted as her, though of course, he had neglected the fact that he was also materializing his books for an indefinite length of time already then.

“Saya’s a girl, y’know. She can’t be sleeping with her dad at this age,” Mika smirked. “Anyway, wanna try the ring out?”

“Sure,” Aize said, taking it from her. “How do I use it?”

“Just channel some mana into it. It doesn’t need much, Saya could do it easily.”

“Okay,” Aize did as instructed, but his mana simply dissipated into the air. He tried once more and the same thing happened. “It doesn’t work.”

“That’s strange. Lemme try.” Aize handed the ring to Mika and she activated it. A bounded space expanded from the ring and surrounded the two. “Nope, it’s working fine.”

Aize was confused; Mika activated it the same way he did. He tried again to no avail. “Oh well, somehow it’s only me,” he shrugged. “Not that it matters, I can do the same with spells.”

“Yep, we can always look into it later,” Mika agreed. They moved toward the door, stopping at any vitrines containing artifacts that caught her interest. As before, Aize was able to activate none of the artifacts they tried. Approaching the open door, he saw that it had a curious pattern on it, not to mention its gigantic size. He wanted to study the things he saw, and made a mental note to bring a camera next time. Beyond the door was a bright corridor, also without the presence of any light source. If the first hall had a golden ambience to it, the corridor was white. Soon after they reached a similar door to the previous one.

“Ta-da! The second room!” Mika exclaimed as soon as they entered it. Despite her calling it a room, like the first one, it was much more of a hall. The design was similar to the previous one, only that the vitrines were arranged in a rectangular pattern. The color theme was different too - sapphire. Aize wondered what determined the color of each hall, and how many magical artifacts there were in the psycheverse. Judging by aura, any single vitrine would bring the owners of the average shops for magical devices in Ayulsa to their knees, and there had to be at least tens of thousands in this hall alone.

“The doors in this room aren’t open,” Aize remarked upon noticing them, as he pondered how many halls were in Mika’s psycheverse.

“Not yet,” Mika said while sitting on one of the wider vitrines nearby. “Just like this one, I’m sure they will when I get stronger.”

Aize nodded. His library also expanded once, so he understood what she was referring to. Wanting to sit as well, he asked, “Is it fine if I sit on this too?”

“Silly Aize, of course it’s fine. C’mere,” Mika smiled, inviting him to sit next to her.

“Thanks,” Aize said after he sat. Looking around a bit more, he then muttered, “So, this is your psycheverse, huh...I like it a lot.”

“I’m glad you do!”

“By the way, does it have no outside?”

“Nope,” Mika shook her head. “There are those doors of course, and we won’t know what’s beyond them until they open, but I think the world inside the walls is all this world is.”

“Interesting. It’s different from my library, then. I can exit it. It’s surrounded by a lake, and there’s a big bridge going to the horizon.”

“You can what, now!?” Mika asked in surprise. “Does this mean what I think it does?”

“Uhm, maybe?” Aize said, a bit confused. “What are you thinking?”

“That you can also enter your psycheverse!” Mika yelled. “I never knew, how come?”

“You never told me you could enter yours until today too, so...”

“I wanna see how your library is like! Can I, Aize?”

“Of course you can,” Aize smiled. “I also want you to be the first one to enter my library.”

“Off we go, then!” Mika said impatiently, unable to contain her excitement.

Aize liked seeing her excited, and prepared to open the portal. Then, realizing that they had been there for a while, he asked, “How do you feel, Mika? Is it okay with me here?”

Mika paused to think about the question. “Mmm...I can’t really tell if there’s a difference compared to being here by myself. A bit...heavier, I guess? I don’t know.”

“If you don’t really notice it, you’re fine,” Aize concluded. “I wonder if I’d be, as well?”

“Let’s find out!”

A portal appeared right under them, and soon after the two vanished from the vault.

___

The portal brought them to a paved area before the entrance of the library. It was located on a small island surrounded by calm water stretching to infinity. Behind them was the bridge Aize mentioned. The weather was fair; the sky blue and somewhat cloudy. The library building was about the same size as the biggest castle in the Central Sector that Aize and Mika had seen only from afar. The architecture was very different however - quite unlike any other building in Ayulsa. As Kierre children were not formally taught about the world outside, much less its history, both of them only thought that the library design was intricate, and the workmanship impressive. While they had no way of knowing it, the design was similar to those of higher learning institutes from eras that were lost to the sands of time.

“Whoa...it really is an island...” Mika said while looking around. Her hair gently waved due to the breeze. She looked at the sky in search of the sun. The weather was sunny, but she did not see it in any direction. There was no shadow to suggest that it was hidden behind the library, either, which was most curious. Of course, just as with the previous world, only the visitor was surprised. The Kierres in question had no such problem accepting their internal worlds - no less naturally than seeing one’s reflection in the mirror - simply as they were.

“Welcome to my psycheverse, Mika. This is the outside I mentioned. Do you want to go inside?”

“Yep, but before that,” Mika turned to the bridge and asked, “How far does it go? Does it end somewhere? What about the lake?”

Aize knew what she would ask. Smirking, he told her, “The lake I don’t know yet. As for the bridge, eight hours straight with the help of wind magic, and absolutely nothing. No signs of an end whatsoever.” About two hundred kilometers, at the level when he attempted that.

“Was this three months ago?” Mika recalled the time when she found Aize to be completely spent in the morning, and was in no state to attend school.

“Mhm.”

“I was wondering what kinda practice it was, for you to end up so badly. I see...were you able to leave your psycheverse normally, so far away from the library?”

“I don’t know. At some point I collapsed, and the next thing I knew I was on my bed. I guess when we run out of mana, we just get ejected?”

Mika came closer and flicked his forehead. “Naughty Aize.” He probably saw it as killing two birds with one stone; improving his magical stamina and sating his curiosity. She did not like how he ran himself down to the point of total mana depletion while being alone. It was by no means obvious that being ejected from the psycheverse would be the outcome in such cases. What if the world simply collapsed, with him stuck inside? She hated to imagine how she would not be there to help him had anything gone wrong. To her, them still keeping their ability to enter their psycheverses a secret at the time was not an acceptable excuse.

Aize originally intended it to be a fun little story, but Mika’s eyes were teary. “Uh, yeah. Sorry. I didn’t mean to worry you. I won’t do--”

Mika did not let him finish. “Nope, I know how crazy you can be. Don’t bother. Instead, just promise to bring me along whenever you’re up to such shenanigans again, okay?”

“Only if you do the same,” Aize said, offering his pinky finger.

“Yep, promise,” Mika said, linking it with hers. “We’ll be strong together, alright? Then we go and investigate the story of your parents.”

“You knew, huh...” Aize sighed. He did not remember telling her that dream of his.

“With how power-obsessed and single-mindedly curious you are, it’s totally obvious,” Mika patted his head. “It’s not like I just met you yesterday.”

“Mmm...fine,” Aize agreed, and silently enjoyed Mika’s soft patting. After a while, he took a deep breath and said, “Thanks, Mika.”

“You’re welcome!” Mika cheerfully answered. “Now, let’s go explore the library!”

They walked to the entrance to the library. Though the wooden door was easily four times the size of their house’s, it was comparatively normal after seeing those in Mika’s vault. Aize opened it and they entered the library. There were bookshelves of all sizes inside, with the larger ones around the edges of the hall. The main counter was at the center of the area, surrounded by many reading desks. Mika chuckled, imagining the droves of people queuing in four directions to check their preferred books out had this been an actual library. On the far side two sets of stairs were seen leading up to the second story and the basement.

“It’s a bit dim for one, but it really is a library, eh, Aize?” Mika remarked, smiling.

“That’s what I’ve been saying the whole time,” Aize shrugged. “Do you want to look at the books first, or do you want to go upstairs?”

“Let’s go upstairs. Is it the same as this area?”

“Mm...for the most part...you’ll see.” They took the right stairs and saw a hall similar in design as the first floor, without the counter at the center. In its place was a curtained area.

“Can I see what’s inside?” Mika asked, brimming with curiosity.

“Go right ahead,” Aize said, anticipating she would like it.

As soon as Mika opened the curtain, her eyes glowed. It was a nap area! Each slot was equipped with a bed, and nicely equipped with its own set of curtains for isolation from the others. She went to sit on the bed of the only slot that happened to be open, and out of curiosity, sneaked a peek at the next one. Seeing how it was much tidier than the one she was in, she surmised that this was the slot Aize used when he visited. “This is the best library ever...” she purred comfortably as she laid down and covered herself with the blanket.

“I knew it,” Aize sighed and sat next to her. “Do you want to stay here, or do you want to see downstairs too?”

“What is it like?” Mika asked, somewhat reluctant to leave the warmth of the blanket. It was very comfortable in the library even without it, but she liked the soft sensation.

“Like this one. Everything the same except for the center and the books,” Aize answered.

“And what about the center?” Mika pressed on, well familiar with his tendency to forget to include the most important part in his answer.

“A buffet area. Dishes, drinks, finger food, desserts, ice cream, and the likes.”

“A what!? Let’s go!” Mika exclaimed, unable to contain her surprise. She went to the stairs and made her way down, with Aize following suit.

When they arrived, indeed there were various dishes served in metal containers. It was like a restaurant built into the library, except there was no kitchen, staff, nor any signs of preparatory work. The smell whetted Mika’s appetite. “Can I try some?”

Aize nodded. “Sure, but first, let me show you something cool.” He brought her to one of the containers and opened it to reveal some nuggets inside. “See, there are thirty. Take some.”

Mika counted them to confirm the claim and took one out. Aize did the same and closed the container. She motioned to ask him if she should eat it, and he nodded.

“Yummy!” Mika gasped upon her first bite. “It’s not quite chicken, is it? It’s similar, but normal ones aren’t this...chickeny,” she described, referring to the taste.

“I don’t know what it is either. There are no meat dishes with bones, and I can materialize only the books, so it’s hard to find out. To make things worse, pictures taken with cameras and so on don’t survive outside the library. Anyway, look at this now,” Aize said, showing her his nugget, and opened the container once again. “Back to thirty.”

“You’re right!” Mika said after counting it herself. “Is it because I ate mine?”

Aize nodded. “To be precise, the first bite and the container being fully closed trigger the refills. Annoyingly, also that there’s no external mana inside it,” he continued while munching on his piece. “Similarly, don’t worry about making a mess, it cleans itself after a while. Though if you really want to, you can always bring the plates to the washing area over there.”

“You investigated a lot, huh?” Mika smiled. “That’s so Aize.”

“It is my psycheverse,” Aize shrugged, handing her wet napkins to wipe her hands with.

“I bet you thought about messing with the vitrines too,” Mika smirked while poking his cheeks. “To check out everything inside me in intimate detail.”

“I...won’t deny or affirm that.”

“Hehe...you can do that all you want,” Mika said, liking his reaction. Back on the buffet, she said, “Your library is nice. People can live here. Perfect for someone like you.”

“Mm...not really,” Aize shook his head. “I taste the dishes, true, but they don’t fill me up. So I’ll starve eventually if I don’t eat actual food.”

“Oh really? I feel filled up as usual. Is it because they’re from your mana supply?”

“I guess so. Anyway, that’s about it for the library itself. Wanna hit the books?”

“Yep. We can also discuss what you’re gonna do in the exams here,” Mika went to the nearest shelf. She brought some books to a table and sat down.

“Psycheverse exam, huh...oh well, let’s do that,” Aize sat on the other side, facing her.

Mika opened a book and saw that it was written in letters completely alien to her. She went to the second book she picked up, and it was the same as before. So it was with all the others. She went to the shelf again to find one she could understand.

“What’s up?” Aize asked, not noticing anything was amiss.

Mika scanned a whole row and did not see anything she knew. It seemed like each book was of a different language. “Aize, the books here are all weird. Is there something I can read?”

“Oh right,” Aize remembered the first time he was able to enter the library. He materialized a few books. “What about these? You can find them in our school library, though.”

Mika returned, failing to find any in the Kierran system of writing. “You can read them all, right? When did you learn all these languages?”

Aize took one of the alien books and opened it. “I didn’t learn any,” he answered, despite being able to understand its contents. “I just know what it says. For example, this one is a story about someone exploring a forest near a rural area. I guess it’s because the books are from my psycheverse? I can’t read it all, by the way. They become readable over time.”

“Just like there are artifacts I can’t use yet,” Mika said. “I see, that makes sense. It depends on our level of mastery. Fine. Now, the exam. Tell me your plans.”

“Urk.” Aize wanted to delay the topic, but could come up with no diversion. “No idea.”

“Don’t the books have any powers?”

“Nope.”

“I can feel the aura around them,” Mika retorted, thinking the books were similar to her artifacts. “We can simply look for a strong one, which has to be powerful, right?”

“They’re books, not magical artifacts,” Aize shook his head. “Sure, some write about magic, and stronger aura means they contain stronger spells. I just need to read them.”

“Okay, go on...”

“Remember the exam specification? It explicitly says to demonstrate the power of the items from your psycheverse. Spells don’t count.”

“Sure, I remember that. What’s the problem with using spells?” Mika asked in confusion.

“It won’t be any different from regular magic,” Aize pointed out. He took one of the books he materialized and showed it to Mika. “Look here. The exact same as the one we’re using in class, but this is from the library. Anyone could just go to the school, pick a copy up, and play with some basic wind magic. How is that showing the power of the items from my psycheverse?”

Mika let out a long sigh. She was genuinely concerned, and it turned out to be only him interpreting the examination instructions in an overly pedantic way. “Gosh, Aize.”

“...what.”

“You can be really silly sometimes, you know that? I’m sure no one will say that it doesn’t count. Your psycheverse is a library, and that makes you a wizard. It suits you very well.” Seeing that he remained unconvinced, Mika continued, “If you’re still worried just pick a spell from one of the books in a different language. They’re uniquely yours.”

“I’m not sure about claiming books I didn’t write as mine is--” Aize retorted, but stopped upon seeing Mika’s glare. “Yeah okay, fine. You win.”

“Ehehe...just let loose with a big one and ace it!”
